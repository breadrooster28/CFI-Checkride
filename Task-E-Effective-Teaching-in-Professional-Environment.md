Scope (ACS mapping)
- Knowledge: FI.I.E.K1–K5 (instructor responsibilities—helping learners, adequate instruction, training to standards, emphasizing positive, minimizing frustrations; flight instructor responsibilities—supervision/surveillance; qualifications/professionalism; professional development; ethics/conduct)
- Risk Management: FI.I.E.R1–R2 (fulfilling responsibilities; exhibiting professionalism)
- Skills: FI.I.E.S1 (deliver instruction consistent with responsibilities/professional characteristics)

What I will teach (Knowledge)
- Instructor responsibilities (AIH): safety, effective teaching, evaluation, guidance, recordkeeping, professionalism; positive reinforcement; minimize frustration; ensure training to standards (ACS-based).
- Professionalism: sincerity, acceptance, appearance, demeanor, language, self-improvement; role modeling.
- Ethics/conduct: honesty, integrity, respect, confidentiality, appropriate endorsements and recordkeeping.
- Supervision: continuous oversight, timely intervention; PIC authority clarity; liability awareness.

How I will manage and teach risk (Risk Management)
- Identify: normalization of deviance, complacency, inadequate supervision, endorsement errors.
- Assess: are standards being met? does behavior model ADM and checklist discipline?
- Mitigate: insist on ACS alignment, personal minimums, timely “stop/knock-it-off,” accurate records/endorsements; ongoing professional development.

How I will demonstrate skills and evaluate learning (Skills)
- Deliver instruction that clearly prioritizes safety, standards, and positive learning climate.
- Maintain supervision and intervention criteria; use positive exchange of controls; set sterile-cockpit periods.
- Provide accurate, standards-based feedback and endorsements only when earned.

Phase-of-instruction techniques
- Pre-brief: clarify roles/PIC; expectations; safety triggers; ethics around endorsements.
- In-flight: model concise communication, checklist usage, workload mgmt.
- Postflight: professional critique; plan development; document accurately.

SBT
- Scenario: time pressure vs. standards; model cancel/delay/divert decision and discuss professionalism and external pressures.

Talk tracks
- “Our standard is the ACS; if it’s not within standard, the correct decision is to stop, brief, and try again later.”

Assessment plan
- Evidence of professional behavior, adherence to standards, accurate records, and ethical decisions.

Quick-reference
- Responsibilities, professionalism traits, ethics checklist, supervision triggers.

Traceability
- AIH: responsibilities, professionalism, ethics, supervision.
- RMH/PHAK: safety culture and ADM.
