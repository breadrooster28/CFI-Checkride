Title: Area VI Task D — Eights on Pylons (CFI Applicant Notes, ASEL)

ACS Objective
- Determine that the applicant can teach eights on pylons procedures, apply it, manage risks, demonstrate skills, and provide effective instruction.

References (per ACS for this Task only)
- FAA-H-8083-2 (Risk Management Handbook)  
- FAA-H-8083-3 (Airplane Flying Handbook)

Scope (ACS mapping)
- Knowledge: FI.VI.D.K1–K3 (pivotal altitude, pylon tracking, wind correction)
- Risk Management: FI.VI.D.R1–R2 (altitude management, traffic avoidance, bank angle control)
- Skills: FI.VI.D.S1–S2 (demonstrate eights on pylons, teach pivotal altitude concept)

What I will teach (Knowledge)
- Eights on pylons: advanced ground reference maneuver using pivotal altitude (AFH 6-6)
- Pivotal altitude calculation: velocity squared divided by 11.3 (for groundspeed in mph)
- Pylon tracking: maintaining wing reference line on pylon throughout turn
- Wind correction: altitude adjustments to maintain proper tracking
- Figure-eight pattern: alternating turns around two pylons with straight segments
- Entry technique: perpendicular between pylons at calculated pivotal altitude

How I will manage and teach risk (Risk Management)
- Identify: altitude deviations, traffic conflicts, excessive bank angles, spatial disorientation
- Assess: wind conditions, terrain clearance, student understanding of pivotal altitude
- Mitigate: calculate proper altitude before entry, maintain traffic awareness
- Practice altitude management and emergency procedures for low altitude work

How I will demonstrate skills and evaluate learning (Skills)
- Demonstrate proper pivotal altitude calculation and application
- Show pylon tracking technique with wing reference line
- Execute smooth transitions between turns with altitude adjustments
- Teach students to recognize and correct tracking errors
- Practice wind effect recognition and altitude correction

Phase-of-instruction techniques
- Ground: Calculate pivotal altitude, explain tracking principles, discuss pylon selection
- Entry: Demonstrate proper setup between pylons at pivotal altitude
- Turns: Show pylon tracking and altitude adjustments for wind correction
- Transitions: Practice smooth reversals between pylons

Scenario-Based Training (SBT)
- Scenario: Eights on pylons using prominent landmarks near M54
- Variables: wind conditions requiring altitude adjustments, traffic considerations
- Focus on pivotal altitude concept and precise tracking

Talk tracks (brief/execute/debrief)
- Pre-brief: "We'll use pivotal altitude to keep the wing reference on the pylon"
- During maneuver: "Adjust altitude to maintain pylon tracking"
- Debrief: "How did altitude changes affect your pylon tracking?"

Assessment plan
- Evaluate pivotal altitude calculation and application
- Assess pylon tracking accuracy and wind correction
- Test understanding of advanced ground reference principles

Quick-reference
- Pivotal altitude: V² ÷ 11.3 (groundspeed in mph)
- Tracking: wing reference line remains on pylon
- Wind correction: altitude adjustments rather than heading changes
- Pattern: figure-eight with smooth transitions between pylons
