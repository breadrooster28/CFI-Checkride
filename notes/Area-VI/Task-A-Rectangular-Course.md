Title: Area VI Task A — Rectangular Course (CFI Applicant Notes, ASEL)

ACS Objective
- Determine that the applicant can teach rectangular course procedures, apply it, manage risks, demonstrate skills, and provide effective instruction.

References (per ACS for this Task only)
- FAA-H-8083-2 (Risk Management Handbook)
- FAA-H-8083-3 (Airplane Flying Handbook)

Scope (ACS mapping)
- Knowledge: FI.VI.A.K1–K3 (ground track control, wind correction, altitude/airspeed management)
- Risk Management: FI.VI.A.R1–R2 (low altitude operations, traffic conflicts, wind effects)
- Skills: FI.VI.A.S1–S2 (demonstrate rectangular course, teach wind correction techniques)

What I will teach (Knowledge)
- Rectangular course fundamentals: ground track control around rectangular pattern (AFH 6-2)
- Wind correction principles: crab angles, ground track vs. heading relationships
- Traffic pattern correlation: relationship to airport operations and spacing
- Altitude management: maintain constant altitude (typically 600-1000 AGL)
- Bank angle considerations: shallow banks for better ground reference visibility
- Entry procedures: 45-degree entry on downwind leg

How I will manage and teach risk (Risk Management)
- Identify: low altitude hazards, terrain/obstacles, traffic conflicts, distraction from primary flight tasks
- Assess: wind conditions vs. pilot capability, terrain clearance, traffic density
- Mitigate: maintain safe altitude, continuous traffic scan, avoid populated areas
- Emphasize collision avoidance and altitude awareness during ground reference work

How I will demonstrate skills and evaluate learning (Skills)
- Demonstrate consistent ground track following rectangular pattern
- Show progressive wind correction techniques throughout the maneuver
- Maintain constant altitude and airspeed during turns and legs
- Teach students to visualize wind effects and adjust accordingly
- Practice different wind conditions and correction techniques

Phase-of-instruction techniques
- Ground: Explain wind triangle, ground track principles, safety considerations
- Entry: Demonstrate proper entry technique and initial wind assessment
- Legs: Show wind correction adjustments on each leg of rectangle
- Turns: Practice coordinated turns with wind correction transitions

Scenario-Based Training (SBT)
- Scenario: Rectangular course around fields near M54 with varying wind conditions
- Variables: wind speed/direction changes, terrain features, traffic considerations
- Focus on wind correction techniques and safety management at low altitude

Talk tracks (brief/execute/debrief)
- Pre-brief: "We'll practice wind correction while maintaining constant ground track"
- During maneuver: "Adjust your heading to maintain the ground track"
- Debrief: "How did you recognize and correct for wind drift?"

Assessment plan
- Evaluate ground track consistency and wind correction effectiveness
- Assess altitude and airspeed control throughout maneuver
- Test understanding of wind effects and correction principles

Quick-reference
- Altitude: maintain 600-1000 AGL consistently
- Ground track: rectangular pattern with equal legs
- Wind correction: adjust heading to maintain desired ground track
- Safety: traffic scan, terrain clearance, emergency landing options
