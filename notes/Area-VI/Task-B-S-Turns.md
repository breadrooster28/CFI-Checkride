Title: Area VI Task B — S-Turns (CFI Applicant Notes, ASEL)

ACS Objective
- Determine that the applicant can teach S-turn procedures, apply it, manage risks, demonstrate skills, and provide effective instruction.

References (per ACS for this Task only)
- FAA-H-8083-2 (Risk Management Handbook)
- FAA-H-8083-3 (Airplane Flying Handbook)

Scope (ACS mapping)
- Knowledge: FI.VI.B.K1–K3 (S-turn technique, wind correction, ground track control)
- Risk Management: FI.VI.B.R1–R2 (low altitude operations, traffic avoidance, wind effects)
- Skills: FI.VI.B.S1–S2 (demonstrate S-turns, teach ground reference techniques)

What I will teach (Knowledge)
- S-turn fundamentals: semicircular turns across perpendicular reference line (AFH 6-3)
- Wind correction techniques: varying bank angles to maintain constant radius turns
- Ground track control: equal semicircles on both sides of reference line
- Bank angle management: steepest bank when perpendicular to wind, shallowest when parallel
- Entry technique: perpendicular to reference line, typically into crosswind
- Altitude and airspeed control during continuous turning

How I will manage and teach risk (Risk Management)
- Identify: low altitude hazards, steep bank angles, traffic conflicts, spatial disorientation
- Assess: wind conditions, terrain clearance, student capability for continuous turns
- Mitigate: maintain safe altitude, limit bank angles, continuous outside scan
- Plan emergency procedures for low altitude maneuvering area

How I will demonstrate skills and evaluate learning (Skills)
- Demonstrate smooth S-turns with varying bank angles for wind correction
- Show constant radius turns despite changing wind effects
- Maintain consistent altitude and airspeed throughout maneuver
- Teach students to anticipate wind effects and adjust bank accordingly
- Practice recognition of proper turn entry and completion points

Phase-of-instruction techniques
- Ground: Explain wind effects on turning radius, bank angle variations
- Entry: Demonstrate proper setup perpendicular to reference line
- Turns: Show progressive bank angle changes throughout each semicircle
- Completion: Practice proper turn rollout and maneuver completion

Scenario-Based Training (SBT)
- Scenario: S-turns along road or section line near M54 with crosswind
- Variables: gusty conditions, varying wind speeds, terrain considerations
- Focus on smooth control inputs and consistent ground track

Talk tracks (brief/execute/debrief)
- Pre-brief: "We'll vary bank angle to maintain constant radius turns"
- During maneuver: "Increase bank as we turn into the wind"
- Debrief: "How did your bank angle changes affect the ground track?"

Assessment plan
- Evaluate consistency of ground track and turn radius
- Assess bank angle management and wind correction
- Test understanding of wind effects on turning flight

Quick-reference
- Technique: varying bank angles, constant radius turns
- Entry: perpendicular to reference line, into crosswind
- Bank management: steepest perpendicular to wind, shallowest parallel
- Altitude: maintain constant throughout maneuver
