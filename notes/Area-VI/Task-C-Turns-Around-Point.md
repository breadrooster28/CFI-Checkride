Title: Area VI Task C — Turns Around a Point (CFI Applicant Notes, ASEL)

ACS Objective
- Determine that the applicant can teach turns around a point procedures, apply it, manage risks, demonstrate skills, and provide effective instruction.

References (per ACS for this Task only)
- FAA-H-8083-2 (Risk Management Handbook)
- FAA-H-8083-3 (Airplane Flying Handbook)

Scope (ACS mapping)
- Knowledge: FI.VI.C.K1–K3 (ground track control, wind correction, radius management)
- Risk Management: FI.VI.C.R1–R2 (low altitude operations, traffic conflicts, bank angle limits)
- Skills: FI.VI.C.S1–S2 (demonstrate turns around a point, teach wind correction)

What I will teach (Knowledge)
- Turns around a point: circular ground track around selected reference point (AFH 6-4)
- Wind correction principles: varying bank angles to maintain constant radius
- Ground track control: perfect circle around point regardless of wind conditions
- Bank angle management: steepest when moving perpendicular to wind, shallowest when parallel
- Point selection: prominent, isolated ground reference suitable for practice
- Entry considerations: downwind entry for maximum wind effect demonstration

How I will manage and teach risk (Risk Management)
- Identify: low altitude hazards, excessive bank angles, traffic conflicts, ground proximity
- Assess: terrain clearance, wind conditions, student experience with steep turns
- Mitigate: maintain safe altitude above obstacles, limit maximum bank angle
- Plan for emergency procedures during low altitude maneuvering

How I will demonstrate skills and evaluate learning (Skills)
- Demonstrate consistent circular ground track around selected point
- Show smooth bank angle transitions throughout 360-degree turn
- Maintain constant altitude and airspeed during continuous turning
- Teach anticipation of wind effects and proper correction timing
- Practice point selection and entry technique

Phase-of-instruction techniques
- Ground: Discuss wind triangle effects in turning flight, point selection criteria
- Entry: Demonstrate proper setup and initial bank establishment
- Turn progression: Show continuous bank angle adjustments for wind correction
- Completion: Practice smooth turn completion and maneuver exit

Scenario-Based Training (SBT)
- Scenario: Turns around prominent landmark near M54 with strong wind conditions
- Variables: wind speed changes, terrain obstacles, traffic considerations
- Focus on smooth control coordination and consistent ground track

Talk tracks (brief/execute/debrief)
- Pre-brief: "We'll maintain a constant radius turn around this point"
- During turn: "Adjust bank angle to keep the point at the same wingtip position"
- Debrief: "How did you anticipate the wind changes during the turn?"

Assessment plan
- Evaluate ground track consistency and radius control
- Assess bank angle management and coordination
- Test understanding of wind effects in turning flight

Quick-reference
- Ground track: constant radius circle around reference point
- Bank management: varies with wind effect, steepest perpendicular to wind
- Entry: typically downwind for maximum demonstration effect
- Altitude: maintain constant throughout 360-degree turn
