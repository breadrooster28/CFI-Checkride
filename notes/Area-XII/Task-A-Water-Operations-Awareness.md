Title: Area XII Task A â€” Water Operations Awareness (CFI Applicant Notes, ASEL)

ACS Objective
- Note: This area is primarily for seaplane operations. For ASEL CFI applicants, understanding water operations concepts provides comprehensive flight instruction knowledge.

References (per ACS for this Task only)
- FAA-H-8083-2 (Risk Management Handbook)
- FAA-H-8083-23 (Seaplane, Skiplane, and Float/Ski Equipped Helicopter Operations Handbook)
- 14 CFR Part 91

Scope (ACS mapping)
- Knowledge: Understanding of water operations concepts for comprehensive instruction
- Risk Management: Awareness of water-specific risks and considerations  
- Skills: Ability to discuss water operations basics with students

What I will teach (Knowledge)
- Water operations concepts: takeoff/landing on water, water characteristics
- Seaplane categories: float planes vs. flying boats, amphibious aircraft
- Water conditions: effect of wind, waves, current on operations
- Special considerations: water rudders, step taxi, porpoising
- Regulatory differences: no specific licenses required but training essential
- Safety considerations: water survival, marine traffic, weather effects

How I will manage and teach risk (Risk Management)
- Identify: water conditions, marine traffic, weather effects, inexperience
- Assess: water suitability, wind/wave conditions, pilot qualifications
- Mitigate: proper training requirements, understanding of water characteristics
- Address the critical importance of specialized seaplane training

How I will demonstrate skills and evaluate learning (Skills)
- Discuss water operations concepts and safety considerations
- Explain differences between land and water operations
- Address when seaplane training becomes appropriate
- Teach importance of proper seaplane instruction and currency
- Provide foundational knowledge for potential future water operations training

Phase-of-instruction techniques
- Ground: Discuss water operations theory and safety considerations
- Application: Relate concepts to land-based operations where applicable
- Planning: Address training progression and water operations considerations

Scenario-Based Training (SBT)
- Scenario: Student inquiring about seaplane operations and training
- Variables: mission requirements, water access, training availability
- Focus on safety considerations and proper training requirements

Talk tracks (brief/execute/debrief)
- Pre-brief: "We'll discuss water operations concepts and safety considerations"
- Discussion: "Water operations require specialized training and different techniques"
- Debrief: "What additional considerations apply to water operations?"

Assessment plan
- Evaluate understanding of water operations concepts
- Assess ability to explain safety considerations and training requirements
- Test knowledge of regulatory and operational differences

Quick-reference
- Key concepts: water characteristics, seaplane types, operational differences
- Training emphasis: specialized instruction required for water operations
- Safety focus: water survival, marine traffic, weather considerations
- Note: ASEL CFI provides conceptual knowledge, not practical water training
