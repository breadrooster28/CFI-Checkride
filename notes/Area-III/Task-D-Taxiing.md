Title: Area III â€” Task D: Taxiing (ASEL, C172M)

ACS Objective
- Determine that I can teach safe taxi techniques with wind correction, route compliance, and incursion prevention, manage risks, demonstrate skills, and provide effective instruction.

References
- FAA-H-8083-25 (PHAK)
- AIM (airport operations, phraseology, runway incursion prevention)
- 14 CFR part 91 (e.g., 91.3, 91.13, 91.129)
- AFM/POH (C172M)
- Chart Supplement U.S.

Scope (ACS mapping)
- Knowledge: Taxi procedures/techniques; wind effects; surface markings/lighting; communications; runway incursion avoidance; collision avoidance; speed control.
- Risk Management: Runway incursions; collisions with aircraft/vehicles/people; loss of control; prop blast; wake turbulence; contaminated surfaces.
- Skills: Maintain directional control; appropriate speed; wind corrections; communications; comply with ATC/ground control; use airport markings/signs.

What I will teach (Knowledge)
- C172M taxi characteristics: steerable nosewheel; differential braking; power/speed relationship.
- Wind corrections: aileron into wind for crosswind/quartering winds; elevator positioning for headwind/tailwind components per AFM/POH.
- Airport markings/signs: runway/taxiway markings; hold short lines; ILS critical area; hot spots per Chart Supplement.
- Communications: ground control frequencies; standard phraseology; readback requirements; progressive taxi if uncertain.
- Speed control: walking pace in congested areas; consider prop blast effects; brake technique and heat management.

How I will manage and teach risk (Risk Management)
- Identify: runway incursion hotspots; other aircraft/vehicles; wingtip clearance; prop blast zones; contaminated surfaces; communication failures.
- Assess: wind effects on control; visibility limitations; complexity of taxi route; traffic density.
- Mitigate: heads-up taxi; positive ATC acknowledgment; when in doubt, stop and ask; use taxi diagram; sterile cockpit during complex taxi; proper wind corrections.

How I will demonstrate skills and evaluate learning (Skills)
- Demonstrate proper control inputs for various wind conditions per AFM/POH guidance.
- Execute progressive taxi request when route unclear; proper readback procedures.
- Show appropriate speed control and spacing from other aircraft.
- Identify and respond to runway incursion scenario or hot spot awareness.

Phase-of-instruction techniques
- Pre-taxi: brief route using airport diagram; identify hot spots; wind considerations; emergency procedures.
- Taxi: maintain outside scan; verbalize control inputs; practice communications; observe traffic.
- Hold short: final checks; positive runway identification; sterile cockpit for takeoff.

SBT
- Scenario: First flight to a busy non-towered field (e.g., M54) with complex taxiway layout and moderate crosswind. Navigate to runway while managing wind, traffic, and unfamiliar airport layout. Emphasize Chart Supplement review and position awareness.

Talk tracks
- "Show me your control inputs for this wind condition and why."
- "What's your plan if you get lost on the taxiway?"
- "How do you know you're clear to cross that taxiway intersection?"

Assessment plan
- Learner maintains directional control with appropriate wind corrections; uses proper communications; complies with markings/clearances; maintains situational awareness.

Quick-reference
- Aileron into wind; appropriate elevator; walking pace; positive readback; when in doubt, stop and ask; Chart Supplement hot spots.

- AIM: Ground operations, runway incursion prevention, phraseology.
- 14 CFR 91: PIC responsibility, controlled airspace operations.
- AFM/POH: Normal procedures and wind limitations.
