Title: Area III — Task A: Preflight Inspection (ASEL, C172M)

ACS Objective
- Determine that I can teach and perform a systematic preflight inspection that ensures the aircraft is safe and legal for flight, manage associated risks, demonstrate skills, and provide effective instruction.

Scope (ACS mapping)
- Knowledge: Purpose and scope of preflight; AFM/POH use; fuel/oil/controls/empennage/landing gear; pitot-static; lights; documents/limitations/placards; discrepancies reporting.
- Risk Management: Ramp/prop hazards; contamination (fuel, frost); maintenance status unknowns; time pressure; unserviceable equipment.
- Skills: Conduct thorough, AFM/POH-based preflight; verify fuel grade/quantity/quality; identify/resolve discrepancies; confirm required documents/markings/placards.

What I will teach (Knowledge)
- AFM/POH as primary reference; use of manufacturer's checklist and flows.
- ARROW presence and applicability; required placards/markings.
- C172M specifics: carbureted engine; fuel sump locations; fuel vent/strainer checks; control surface hinges/secure hardware; flap tracks (0–40° capable, per AFM/POH); tire/brake/strut cues; pitot/static ports; antennae.
- Fuel management: correct grade; quantity vs. mission; sampling for contamination.
- Environmental hazards: frost/ice, FOD, tiedowns/chocks, gust locks.

How I will manage and teach risk (Risk Management)
- Identify: rushing, checklist omission, distractions, ramp traffic, prop arcs, contamination, unlogged defects.
- Assess: consequence of "minor" defects; likelihood of progression in flight; legality vs. safety delta.
- Mitigate: sterile preflight period; do-not-disturb rule; point-and-touch checklist use; document and defer to maintenance when required; do not rationalize away defects.

How I will demonstrate skills and evaluate learning (Skills)
- Perform a complete preflight using AFM/POH; student leads, I probe with "why/what if."
- Verify ARROW and required placards; cross-check limitations with mission.
- Sample all sumps; verify caps/vents; check oil level within AFM/POH limits.
- Identify a seeded discrepancy (e.g., loose cotter pin, missing fuel cap gasket) and choose appropriate action.

Phase-of-instruction techniques
- Preflight: establish sterile period; verbalize each item; physically verify critical items.
- Ramp: prop awareness; wing-walker spacing when needed; chocks until start.
- Documentation: discrepancy write-up and communication to maintenance.

SBT
- Scenario: Evening local flight at a non-towered field (e.g., M54). You find a small amount of water in a wing sump after heavy rain and a landing light lens crack. Decide: continue or no-go? Discuss 91.7/91.9, AFM/POH, night ops needs.

Talk tracks
- "Show me where the AFM/POH specifies that limit."
- "If you can't explain it, we don't fly it."
- "What changed after the last flight that could alter today's risk?"

Assessment plan
- Learner demonstrates a complete, unhurried, AFM/POH-aligned preflight; identifies hazards; makes conservative, standards-based decisions; documents discrepancies appropriately.

Quick-reference
- ARROW; AFM/POH checklist; sumps/caps/vents; controls free/correct; tires/brakes/struts; pitot/static; lights; placards.
- If in doubt → stop and resolve.
