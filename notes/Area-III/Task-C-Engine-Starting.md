Title: Area III — Task C: Engine Starting (ASEL, C172M)

ACS Objective
- Determine that I can teach safe, AFM/POH-compliant engine start procedures, manage associated risks, demonstrate skills, and provide effective instruction.

References
- FAA-H-8083-25 (PHAK)
- AIM (ramp safety)
- 14 CFR part 91 (e.g., 91.3, 91.13)
- AFM/POH (C172M)

Scope (ACS mapping)
- Knowledge: AFM/POH normal/hot/flooded/cold starts; priming; mixture/ throttle positions; carburetor and magnetos; area clear, chocks/brakes; after-start checks.
- Risk Management: Prop arc hazards; fire during start; hand-propping prohibition unless authorized/qualified; carbon monoxide/ventilation; electrical/battery management.
- Skills: Proper callouts; area clear; correct start technique per conditions; immediate response to abnormal indications.

What I will teach (Knowledge)
- C172M procedures: mixture, throttle, primer use per AFM/POH; magneto safety; carb heat as applicable; oil pressure time-to-rise expectations per AFM/POH.
- After-start: oil pressure/ammeter/annunciators; radios/avionics on; taxi clearance (if towered); transponder standby.

How I will manage and teach risk (Risk Management)
- Identify: people/vehicles/equipment near prop arc; tiedowns/chocks; fuel pooling risk; over-priming.
- Assess: fire likelihood; weak battery/hot start challenges; wind and FOD.
- Mitigate: "Clear prop!" and visual scan; brakes set; fire plan brief (mixture idle cutoff, throttle full open, continue cranking, fuel off, mags off, master off, evacuate—per AFM/POH); use wheel chocks as needed.

How I will demonstrate skills and evaluate learning (Skills)
- Perform normal start; then brief and conduct a hot/flooded start per AFM/POH.
- Execute an immediate-action "fire during start" simulation to verbalize steps in order.

Phase-of-instruction techniques
- Before start: passenger brief includes prop danger and signals.
- During start: loud clear-prop call; eyes outside; hand on mixture during first start moments.
- After start: stabilize RPM; verify gauges; lean for taxi to reduce fouling.

SBT
- Scenario: Post-fueling hot start on a warm day; battery slightly weak. Manage start without over-priming; brief abort/fire plan; decide whether to seek a GPU or maintenance.

Talk tracks
- "Tell me when oil pressure must be in the green and what you'll do if it's not."
- "What are your immediate actions if you see smoke/flames at the cowling?"

Assessment plan
- Learner applies AFM/POH procedures precisely, maintains situational awareness, and can recite/do fire-abort actions correctly.

Quick-reference
- Area clear; brakes set; correct prime; "Clear prop!"; verify oil pressure; after-start checks; fire plan.
