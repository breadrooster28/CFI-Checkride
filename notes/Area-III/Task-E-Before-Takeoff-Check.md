Title: Area III â€” Task E: Before Takeoff Check (ASEL, C172M)

ACS Objective
- Determine that I can teach systematic before takeoff checks that ensure aircraft readiness and safety for departure, manage associated risks, demonstrate skills, and provide effective instruction.

- AIM (airport operations, runway incursion prevention)
- 14 CFR part 91 (e.g., 91.3, 91.103, 91.109, 91.213)

Scope (ACS mapping)
- Knowledge: AFM/POH checklist procedures; engine/systems checks; flight controls; performance calculations; weather review; takeoff briefing.
- Risk Management: Rushed procedures; incomplete checks; engine/systems malfunctions; abort decisions; runway incursion; traffic conflicts.
- Skills: Complete systematic checks per AFM/POH; verify performance data; brief takeoff/abort procedures; maintain runway awareness.

What I will teach (Knowledge)
- C172M before takeoff checklist: engine runup (magnetos, carb heat, engine instruments); flight controls free and correct; trim setting; mixture/prop/fuel; radios/transponder set.
- Performance verification: runway length vs. required distance; weight and balance within limits; density altitude effects; obstacle clearance.
- Takeoff briefing elements: abort criteria and procedures; initial climb profile; emergency procedures (EFATO); traffic pattern entry.
- Final items: passenger brief review; positive exchange of controls; sterile cockpit declaration.

How I will manage and teach risk (Risk Management)
- Identify: rushing due to traffic/weather; incomplete runup; engine anomalies; inadequate performance margins; runway incursion during checks.
- Assess: engine parameters vs. AFM/POH limits; weather vs. personal minimums; runway condition and length adequacy.
- Mitigate: dedicated runup area when available; systematic checklist discipline; conservative abort criteria; clear traffic scan; performance calculations with margins.

How I will demonstrate skills and evaluate learning (Skills)
- Perform complete AFM/POH runup with proper engine parameters and troubleshooting of minor discrepancies.
- Calculate takeoff performance for current conditions and brief abort/continue criteria.
- Execute positive control exchange and emergency brief appropriate to departure environment.
- Demonstrate runway scan and communication procedures before entering runway.

Phase-of-instruction techniques
- Runup area: use checklist methodically; investigate any anomalies; lean mixture as appropriate for field elevation.
- Hold short: final performance verification; traffic scan; positive ATC acknowledgment or CTAF position call.
- Before entering runway: final control check; abort briefing; sterile cockpit initiated.

SBT
- Scenario: Departure from high density altitude airport (e.g., mountain airport) with moderate wind and rising temperature. Calculate performance, brief abort criteria, and manage engine parameters for altitude. Discuss density altitude effects on both takeoff performance and engine operation.

Talk tracks
- "Walk me through the abort criteria for today's takeoff."
- "What engine indication would cause you to abort this takeoff?"
- "Show me where the AFM/POH gives you that performance number."

Assessment plan
- Learner completes thorough, unhurried checklist; calculates accurate performance data; briefs clear abort criteria; maintains situation awareness throughout.

Quick-reference
- AFM/POH checklist discipline; performance calculations; abort criteria briefing; positive control exchange; traffic awareness.
