Title: Area III — Task B: Cockpit Management (ASEL, C172M)

ACS Objective
- Determine that I can teach organization, setup, and use of the cockpit to reduce workload and error, manage associated risks, demonstrate skills, and provide effective instruction.

Scope (ACS mapping)
- Knowledge: Checklist usage; flows; avionics setup; charts/NOTAMs; weight-and-balance/performance at hand; passenger briefing; emergency equipment; sterile cockpit.
- Risk Management: Distraction management; loose items/FOD; poor chart/data organization; task saturation; incursion risk.
- Skills: Arrange cockpit for access; set radios/nav; brief passengers; secure items; apply sterile cockpit periods.

What I will teach (Knowledge)
- Standardized flows then verify with checklist.
- Organizing charts, EFB, and backups; securing kneeboard, pens, devices.
- C172M avionics basics; intercom/volume/squelch; transponder/altitude reporting readiness.
- Passenger/crew brief (seats/belts/doors, sterile periods, emergency plan, controls exchange).

How I will manage and teach risk (Risk Management)
- Identify: unsecured items, ad hoc EFB use, split attention during taxi/takeoff, non-essential chatter.
- Assess: probability of distraction at hotspots; consequence of item jam or interference.
- Mitigate: binders/clips/Velcro; pre-program radios; sterile cockpit from start to 1000' AGL; CTAF/traffic scan plan.

How I will demonstrate skills and evaluate learning (Skills)
- Set up radios (e.g., CTAF/ATIS), transponder, intercom, and audio panel before engine start where appropriate and per AFM/POH.
- Secure cabin items and ensure free/clear flight controls.
- Deliver a concise passenger brief including positive exchange of controls.

Phase-of-instruction techniques
- Prestart: data and radio setup; papers/devices stowed and accessible.
- Taxi: heads-up; defer nonessential tasks; verbalize "sterile cockpit."
- Before takeoff: confirm final setup with checklist.

SBT
- Scenario: Training sortie at a non-towered field with complex taxi. You must copy winds/traffic, set radios, and brief a student while holding short. Prioritize and sequence tasks to avoid incursion.

Talk tracks
- "What can we set up on the ground to reduce heads-down time later?"
- "What gets deferred until holding short or in cruise?"
- "Where do we store this so it can't jam the controls?"

Assessment plan
- Learner arranges cockpit, secures items, programs equipment, and maintains heads-up discipline; uses checklist/flows effectively.

Quick-reference
- Flow → checklist; secure loose items; sterile cockpit; passenger brief; final verify before takeoff.

Traceability
