Title: Area VIII Task B — Constant Airspeed Climbs (CFI Applicant Notes, ASEL)

ACS Objective
- Determine that the applicant can teach constant airspeed climbs by reference to instruments, apply it, manage risks, demonstrate skills, and provide effective instruction.

References (per ACS for this Task only)
- FAA-H-8083-2 (Risk Management Handbook)
- FAA-H-8083-15 (Instrument Flying Handbook)
- FAA-H-8083-25 (Pilot's Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge)

Scope (ACS mapping)
- Knowledge: FI.VIII.B.K1–K3 (climb techniques, power/attitude relationships, instrument interpretation)
- Risk Management: FI.VIII.B.R1–R2 (airspeed control, altitude deviations, power management)
- Skills: FI.VIII.B.S1–S2 (demonstrate instrument climbs, teach airspeed control)

What I will teach (Knowledge)
- Constant airspeed climb technique: attitude for airspeed, power for rate of climb (IFH 5-7)
- C172M climb performance: Vy (79 KIAS) for best rate, typical climb power 2400 RPM
- Instrument interpretation: attitude indicator primary for pitch, airspeed for performance
- Power/attitude relationship: coordinated power and attitude changes for smooth climbs
- Trim usage: maintain desired attitude without control pressure
- Level-off technique: anticipate altitude by 10% of rate of climb

How I will manage and teach risk (Risk Management)
- Identify: airspeed deviations, altitude overshoots, power mismanagement, scan breakdown
- Assess: student understanding of power/attitude relationship, scan discipline
- Mitigate: emphasize smooth control inputs, proper anticipation techniques
- Practice various climb rates and target altitudes

How I will demonstrate skills and evaluate learning (Skills)
- Demonstrate smooth climb entry with coordinated power and attitude changes
- Show constant airspeed maintenance throughout climb
- Execute proper level-off technique with altitude anticipation
- Teach power/attitude relationship and its application
- Practice climbs to specific altitudes with precision

Phase-of-instruction techniques
- Ground: Discuss climb theory, power/attitude relationships, level-off techniques
- Entry: Demonstrate coordinated power and attitude changes
- Climb: Show airspeed control and scan technique
- Level-off: Practice anticipation and smooth altitude capture

Scenario-Based Training (SBT)
- Scenario: IFR departure with climb to assigned altitude
- Variables: turbulence, power limitations, ATC altitude changes
- Focus on precise airspeed control and altitude capture

Talk tracks (brief/execute/debrief)
- Pre-brief: "We'll use attitude for airspeed, power for climb rate"
- During climb: "Maintain 79 knots, adjust power for desired rate"
- Debrief: "How did you coordinate power and attitude changes?"

Assessment plan
- Evaluate airspeed control during climb (±5 knots)
- Assess level-off precision and technique
- Test understanding of power/attitude relationships

Quick-reference
- C172M technique: 79 KIAS climb speed, 2400 RPM climb power
- Control: attitude for airspeed, power for rate of climb
- Level-off: anticipate by 10% of climb rate
- Standards: ±5 knots airspeed, ±100 feet final altitude
