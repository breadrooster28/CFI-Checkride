Title: Area VIII Task C — Constant Airspeed Descents (CFI Applicant Notes, ASEL)

ACS Objective
- Determine that the applicant can teach constant airspeed descents by reference to instruments, apply it, manage risks, demonstrate skills, and provide effective instruction.

- FAA-H-8083-2 (Risk Management Handbook)
- FAA-H-8083-15 (Instrument Flying Handbook)
- FAA-H-8083-25 (Pilot's Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge)

Scope (ACS mapping)
- Knowledge: FI.VIII.C.K1–K3 (descent techniques, power/attitude relationships, energy management)
- Risk Management: FI.VIII.C.R1–R2 (airspeed control, altitude management, power changes)
- Skills: FI.VIII.C.S1–S2 (demonstrate instrument descents, teach energy management)

What I will teach (Knowledge)
- Constant airspeed descent: attitude for airspeed, power for rate of descent (IFH 5-8)
- C172M descent technique: maintain cruise airspeed with reduced power
- Descent rates: typical 500 fpm descent with partial power reduction
- Instrument interpretation: attitude indicator primary for pitch control
- Energy management: trading altitude for airspeed control
- Level-off technique: anticipate by 10% of descent rate, add power smoothly

How I will manage and teach risk (Risk Management)
- Identify: excessive descent rates, airspeed deviations, altitude undershoots
- Assess: power management understanding, descent planning
- Mitigate: practice controlled descents, emphasize smooth power changes
- Plan for go-around or missed approach scenarios

How I will demonstrate skills and evaluate learning (Skills)
- Demonstrate smooth descent entry with power reduction
- Maintain constant airspeed throughout descent
- Execute precise level-off at target altitude
- Show proper energy management and descent planning
- Practice various descent rates and configurations

Phase-of-instruction techniques
- Ground: Discuss descent theory and energy management
- Entry: Show coordinated power reduction and attitude adjustment
- Descent: Demonstrate airspeed control and rate management
- Level-off: Practice smooth power addition and altitude capture

Scenario-Based Training (SBT)
- Scenario: Instrument approach descent to specific altitudes
- Variables: turbulence, changing winds, altitude restrictions
- Focus on precise altitude control and energy management

Talk tracks (brief/execute/debrief)
- Pre-brief: "We'll control descent rate with power, airspeed with attitude"
- During descent: "Maintain airspeed, adjust power for descent rate"
- Debrief: "How effectively did you manage the descent energy?"

Assessment plan
- Evaluate airspeed control during descent (±5 knots)
- Assess level-off precision and smoothness
- Test understanding of energy management principles

Quick-reference
- Technique: attitude for airspeed, power for descent rate
- C172M: reduce power for desired descent rate, maintain airspeed
- Level-off: anticipate by 10% of descent rate
- Standards: ±5 knots airspeed, ±100 feet final altitude
