Title: Area VIII Task A — Straight-and-Level Flight (CFI Applicant Notes, ASEL)

ACS Objective
- Determine that the applicant can teach straight-and-level flight by reference to instruments, apply it, manage risks, demonstrate skills, and provide effective instruction.

References (per ACS for this Task only)
- FAA-H-8083-2 (Risk Management Handbook)
- FAA-H-8083-15 (Instrument Flying Handbook)
- FAA-H-8083-25 (Pilot's Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge)

Scope (ACS mapping)
- Knowledge: FI.VIII.A.K1–K3 (instrument interpretation, cross-check techniques, control techniques)
- Risk Management: FI.VIII.A.R1–R2 (spatial disorientation, instrument failures, fixation)
- Skills: FI.VIII.A.S1–S2 (demonstrate instrument flight, teach scan techniques)

What I will teach (Knowledge)
- Instrument cross-check: systematic scan of flight instruments for aircraft control (IFH 5-2)
- Primary and supporting instruments: attitude indicator as primary reference
- Control and performance concept: small corrections, smooth control inputs
- C172M power settings: cruise power (2300-2400 RPM) for level flight
- Trim technique: use trim to relieve control pressures
- Common errors: fixation, omission, emphasis errors in scan pattern

How I will manage and teach risk (Risk Management)
- Identify: spatial disorientation, instrument failures, scan breakdown, control fixation
- Assess: student readiness for instrument flight, understanding of instrument limitations
- Mitigate: emphasize proper scan technique, practice partial panel procedures
- Teach recognition of and recovery from spatial disorientation

How I will demonstrate skills and evaluate learning (Skills)
- Demonstrate proper instrument cross-check and interpretation
- Show smooth control inputs and use of trim for precise flight
- Maintain altitude within ±100 feet and heading within ±10 degrees
- Teach systematic scan development and error recognition
- Practice various power settings and configurations

Phase-of-instruction techniques
- Ground: Discuss instrument layout, scan patterns, control philosophy
- Initial: Demonstrate basic attitude instrument flying
- Development: Practice systematic scan and smooth corrections
- Application: Integrate scan with various flight maneuvers

Scenario-Based Training (SBT)
- Scenario: VFR flight encountering reduced visibility requiring instrument flight
- Variables: turbulence, instrument failures, communication requirements
- Focus on scan discipline and precise aircraft control

Talk tracks (brief/execute/debrief)
- Pre-brief: "We'll focus on systematic instrument scan and smooth control"
- During flight: "Cross-check attitude, airspeed, altitude, heading"
- Debrief: "How did your scan pattern develop? What needed improvement?"

Assessment plan
- Evaluate instrument cross-check technique and accuracy
- Assess control smoothness and precision
- Test understanding of instrument interpretation and scan principles

Quick-reference
- Scan pattern: attitude, altitude, airspeed, heading, systematic cross-check
- Control: small corrections, use of trim, smooth inputs
- Standards: ±100 feet altitude, ±10 degrees heading
- C172M: 2300-2400 RPM for cruise level flight
