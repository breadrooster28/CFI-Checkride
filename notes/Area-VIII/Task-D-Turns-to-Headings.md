Title: Area VIII Task D — Turns to Headings (CFI Applicant Notes, ASEL)

ACS Objective
- Determine that the applicant can teach turns to headings by reference to instruments, apply it, manage risks, demonstrate skills, and provide effective instruction.

References (per ACS for this Task only)
- FAA-H-8083-2 (Risk Management Handbook)
- FAA-H-8083-15 (Instrument Flying Handbook)

Scope (ACS mapping)
- Knowledge: FI.VIII.D.K1–K3 (turn techniques, standard rate turns, roll-out anticipation)
- Risk Management: FI.VIII.D.R1–R2 (altitude control, turn coordination, overbanking)
- Skills: FI.VIII.D.S1–S2 (demonstrate instrument turns, teach heading control)

What I will teach (Knowledge)
- Standard rate turns: 3 degrees per second, 360 degrees in 2 minutes (IFH 5-9)
- Turn coordination: coordinated aileron and rudder, maintain level flight
- Bank angle for standard rate: approximately 15 degrees for typical training aircraft
- Roll-out anticipation: lead desired heading by half the bank angle
- Heading control: precise use of heading indicator and turn coordinator
- Altitude control: maintain level flight throughout turn

How I will manage and teach risk (Risk Management)
- Identify: altitude deviations, overbanking, uncoordinated turns, heading overshoots
- Assess: coordination skills, scan discipline, heading control precision
- Mitigate: emphasize smooth control inputs, proper scan technique
- Practice various turn rates and heading changes

How I will demonstrate skills and evaluate learning (Skills)
- Demonstrate smooth turn entry with coordinated controls
- Maintain standard rate turn indication throughout
- Execute precise roll-out to desired heading
- Show altitude control during turns
- Teach turn anticipation and heading capture techniques

Phase-of-instruction techniques
- Ground: Discuss turn coordination, rate control, anticipation techniques
- Entry: Show coordinated turn entry and rate establishment
- Turn: Demonstrate altitude control and rate maintenance
- Roll-out: Practice heading anticipation and capture

Scenario-Based Training (SBT)
- Scenario: IFR flight with multiple heading changes for traffic separation
- Variables: turbulence, rapid heading changes, altitude restrictions
- Focus on precise heading control and coordination

Talk tracks (brief/execute/debrief)
- Pre-brief: "We'll practice precise heading control with coordinated turns"
- During turns: "Maintain standard rate, anticipate the roll-out"
- Debrief: "How accurately did you capture the assigned headings?"

Assessment plan
- Evaluate turn coordination and rate control
- Assess heading capture precision (±5 degrees)
- Test understanding of turn techniques and anticipation

Quick-reference
- Standard rate: 3°/second, approximately 15° bank angle
- Coordination: coordinated aileron and rudder inputs
- Roll-out: anticipate by half the bank angle
- Standards: ±100 feet altitude, ±5 degrees heading
