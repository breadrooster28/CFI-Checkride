Title: Area VIII Task E — Recovery from Unusual Flight Attitudes (CFI Applicant Notes, ASEL)

ACS Objective
- Determine that the applicant can teach recovery from unusual flight attitudes by reference to instruments, apply it, manage risks, demonstrate skills, and provide effective instruction.

References (per ACS for this Task only)
- FAA-H-8083-2 (Risk Management Handbook)
- FAA-H-8083-15 (Instrument Flying Handbook)

Scope (ACS mapping)
- Knowledge: FI.VIII.E.K1–K3 (unusual attitude recognition, recovery procedures, spatial disorientation)
- Risk Management: FI.VIII.E.R1–R2 (disorientation effects, recovery priorities, secondary stalls)
- Skills: FI.VIII.E.S1–S2 (demonstrate recovery procedures, teach recognition techniques)

What I will teach (Knowledge)
- Unusual attitude definition: unintended aircraft attitude outside normal flight parameters (IFH 5-15)
- Recognition techniques: instrument interpretation, attitude indicator primary reference
- Recovery priorities: wings level first, then power and pitch as appropriate
- Nose-high recovery: reduce power, level wings, lower nose, increase power as needed
- Nose-low recovery: level wings, reduce power, gently raise nose, add power as needed
- Spatial disorientation: causes, effects, and prevention techniques

How I will manage and teach risk (Risk Management)
- Identify: spatial disorientation, panic responses, inappropriate control inputs
- Assess: student understanding of instrument interpretation and recovery priorities
- Mitigate: emphasize systematic recovery procedures, practice in controlled environment
- Address disorientation recognition and management techniques

How I will demonstrate skills and evaluate learning (Skills)
- Demonstrate recognition of unusual attitudes from instrument indications
- Show systematic recovery procedures for various unusual attitudes
- Maintain proper recovery priorities and smooth control inputs
- Teach students to avoid panic and follow established procedures
- Practice recovery from instructor-induced unusual attitudes

Phase-of-instruction techniques
- Ground: Discuss spatial disorientation, recovery procedures, priorities
- Recognition: Practice identifying unusual attitudes from instruments
- Recovery: Demonstrate systematic recovery procedures
- Application: Practice various unusual attitude scenarios

Scenario-Based Training (SBT)
- Scenario: IMC flight with distraction leading to unusual attitude
- Variables: turbulence, instrument failures, high workload situations
- Focus on recognition speed and systematic recovery procedures

Talk tracks (brief/execute/debrief)
- Pre-brief: "We'll practice systematic recovery from unusual attitudes"
- During recovery: "Read the instruments, wings level first, then power and pitch"
- Debrief: "How quickly did you recognize and begin recovery?"

Assessment plan
- Evaluate recognition speed and accuracy
- Assess recovery procedure execution and priorities
- Test understanding of spatial disorientation and prevention

Quick-reference
- Recognition: attitude indicator primary, cross-check other instruments
- Recovery priority: wings level, then power and pitch as appropriate
- Nose-high: reduce power, level wings, lower nose
- Nose-low: level wings, reduce power, gently raise nose
