Title: Area XI Task A — Postflight Procedures (CFI Applicant Notes, ASEL)

ACS Objective
- Determine that the applicant can teach postflight procedures, apply it, manage risks, demonstrate skills, and provide effective instruction.

References (per ACS for this Task only)
- FAA-H-8083-2 (Risk Management Handbook)
- FAA-H-8083-3 (Airplane Flying Handbook)
- POH/AFM (C172M)

Scope (ACS mapping)
- Knowledge: FI.XI.A.K1–K3 (postflight inspection, securing aircraft, documentation)
- Risk Management: FI.XI.A.R1–R2 (aircraft security, maintenance issues, documentation accuracy)
- Skills: FI.XI.A.S1–S2 (demonstrate postflight procedures, teach proper techniques)

What I will teach (Knowledge)
- Postflight inspection: engine cooling, discrepancy identification, damage assessment
- Aircraft securing: control locks, tie-downs, power shutdown procedures
- C172M postflight: engine cooling period, mixture lean, master switch off
- Documentation requirements: flight time logging, discrepancy reporting, maintenance entries
- Security considerations: aircraft security, key control, hangar procedures
- Passenger briefing: deplaning procedures, safety considerations

How I will manage and teach risk (Risk Management)
- Identify: maintenance discrepancies, security issues, incomplete documentation
- Assess: aircraft condition, security requirements, regulatory compliance
- Mitigate: thorough inspection, proper documentation, secure aircraft storage
- Address maintenance reporting and airworthiness responsibilities

How I will demonstrate skills and evaluate learning (Skills)
- Demonstrate systematic postflight inspection procedures
- Show proper aircraft securing and power shutdown techniques
- Execute accurate flight documentation and discrepancy reporting
- Teach students to identify maintenance issues and security concerns
- Practice various postflight scenarios and conditions

Phase-of-instruction techniques
- Ground: Discuss postflight responsibilities and procedures
- Inspection: Demonstrate systematic aircraft inspection
- Securing: Show proper tie-down and power shutdown procedures
- Documentation: Practice accurate logging and reporting

Scenario-Based Training (SBT)
- Scenario: Postflight after cross-country flight to M54
- Variables: weather considerations, maintenance discrepancies, security requirements
- Focus on thorough inspection and proper documentation

Talk tracks (brief/execute/debrief)
- Pre-brief: "We'll complete a thorough postflight inspection and documentation"
- During inspection: "Look for any discrepancies or damage from the flight"
- Debrief: "What maintenance issues require attention? How accurate was your documentation?"

Assessment plan
- Evaluate inspection thoroughness and accuracy
- Assess aircraft securing and documentation procedures
- Test understanding of maintenance reporting and security requirements

Quick-reference
- C172M shutdown: mixture lean, master off, controls secured
- Inspection: systematic check for damage or discrepancies
- Documentation: accurate flight time, discrepancy reporting
- Security: aircraft tied down, secured, keys controlled
