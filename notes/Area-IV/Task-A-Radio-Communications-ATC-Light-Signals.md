Title: Area IV Task A — Radio Communications and ATC Light Signals (CFI Applicant Notes, ASEL)

ACS Objective
- Determine that the applicant can teach radio communications and ATC light signals, apply it, manage risks, demonstrate skills, and provide effective instruction.

References (per ACS for this Task only)
- FAA-H-8083-2 (Risk Management Handbook)
- FAA-H-8083-3 (Airplane Flying Handbook)
- FAA-H-8083-25 (Pilot's Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge)
- AIM (Aeronautical Information Manual)
- 14 CFR Part 91

Scope (ACS mapping)
- Knowledge: FI.IV.A.K1–K3 (radio communication procedures, phraseology, ATC light signals)
- Risk Management: FI.IV.A.R1–R2 (communication failures, misunderstood clearances)
- Skills: FI.IV.A.S1–S2 (demonstrate proper radio procedures, teach light signal recognition)

What I will teach (Knowledge)
- Standard radio phraseology and communication procedures (AIM Chapter 4)
- Non-towered airport communication procedures (AIM 4-1-9)
- Communication failure procedures (14 CFR 91.185, AIM 4-2-13)
- ATC light signal meanings and appropriate responses (AIM 4-3-13)
- Radio equipment operation and backup procedures
- Common communication errors and their prevention

How I will manage and teach risk (Risk Management)
- Identify: communication equipment failures, frequency congestion, misunderstood instructions, language barriers
- Assess: verify understanding through readbacks, monitor for compliance with clearances
- Mitigate: use standard phraseology, maintain backup communication methods, establish clear protocols for communication failures
- Teach students to recognize and respond to communication breakdowns appropriately

How I will demonstrate skills and evaluate learning (Skills)
- Demonstrate proper radio procedures with clear, concise phraseology
- Practice communication scenarios including normal and emergency situations
- Teach recognition of and response to ATC light signals
- Monitor student communications and provide immediate feedback
- Use role-playing exercises to simulate various communication scenarios

Phase-of-instruction techniques
- Ground: Review communication procedures, practice phraseology, discuss light signals
- Preflight: Brief communication plan, frequencies, backup procedures
- Taxi: Practice ground control communications, readback procedures
- Pattern: Demonstrate proper position reports and traffic calls at non-towered fields (e.g., M54)
- Postflight: Debrief communication effectiveness and areas for improvement

Scenario-Based Training (SBT)
- Scenario: Flight to M54 (non-towered) with communication equipment failure
- Variables: busy traffic pattern, need for light signals, coordination with other aircraft
- Decision points: when to use alternative communication methods, light signal recognition
- Debrief: effectiveness of backup procedures, situational awareness maintenance

Talk tracks (brief/execute/debrief)
- Pre-brief: "We'll practice standard phraseology and discuss backup communication procedures"
- In-flight: "State your position, intentions, and listen for other traffic"
- Debrief: "How did your communication affect traffic flow and safety?"

Assessment plan
- Evaluate proper use of standard phraseology
- Assess ability to maintain communication in various scenarios
- Test knowledge of light signal meanings and responses
- Observe student's ability to teach others proper communication procedures

Quick-reference
- Standard phraseology checklist
- Light signal meanings and responses
- Communication failure procedures
- Non-towered airport procedures
