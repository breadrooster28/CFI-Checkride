Title: Area IV Task B — Traffic Patterns (CFI Applicant Notes, ASEL)

ACS Objective
- Determine that the applicant can teach traffic patterns, apply it, manage risks, demonstrate skills, and provide effective instruction.

References (per ACS for this Task only)
- FAA-H-8083-2 (Risk Management Handbook)
- FAA-H-8083-3 (Airplane Flying Handbook)
- FAA-H-8083-25 (Pilot's Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge)
- AIM (Aeronautical Information Manual)
- AC 90-66B (Non-Towered Airport Flight Operations)

Scope (ACS mapping)
- Knowledge: FI.IV.B.K1–K4 (traffic pattern procedures, entry/departure, right/left patterns, non-towered operations)
- Risk Management: FI.IV.B.R1–R3 (pattern conflicts, wake turbulence, communication issues)
- Skills: FI.IV.B.S1–S3 (demonstrate proper pattern flying, teach pattern procedures, manage traffic conflicts)

What I will teach (Knowledge)
- Standard traffic pattern components and altitudes (AIM 4-3-3)
- Traffic pattern entry procedures (45-degree entry, straight-in, base leg) (AIM 4-3-4)
- Right vs. left traffic patterns and determining pattern direction (AIM 4-3-4)
- Non-towered airport procedures and self-announce practices (AC 90-66B)
- Wake turbulence considerations in the pattern (AIM 7-4-3)
- Pattern departure procedures and traffic avoidance
- Emergency pattern procedures (engine failure, radio failure)

How I will manage and teach risk (Risk Management)
- Identify: conflicting traffic, wake turbulence, improper pattern entries, communication failures
- Assess: scan for traffic continuously, maintain appropriate spacing, monitor weather conditions
- Mitigate: use standard pattern procedures, maintain proper altitudes and speeds, communicate intentions clearly
- Teach collision avoidance through proper scanning and positioning (RMH Chapter 3)

How I will demonstrate skills and evaluate learning (Skills)
- Demonstrate proper traffic pattern flying with consistent altitude and airspeed
- Teach standard pattern entries and departures at non-towered fields like M54
- Model effective traffic scanning and collision avoidance techniques
- Practice various pattern scenarios including emergency procedures
- Evaluate student's ability to maintain pattern discipline and traffic awareness

Phase-of-instruction techniques
- Ground: Review pattern procedures, discuss airport-specific information
- Pattern entry: Demonstrate 45-degree entry at pattern altitude
- Downwind: Maintain proper spacing, perform before-landing checks
- Base/Final: Teach stabilized approach criteria and go-around decisions
- Departure: Practice various departure procedures and traffic avoidance

Scenario-Based Training (SBT)
- Scenario: Busy pattern at M54 with mixed traffic (training aircraft, transient aircraft)
- Variables: right traffic pattern, wake turbulence from larger aircraft, radio congestion
- Decision points: pattern entry choice, spacing adjustments, go-around criteria
- 3P process: Perceive traffic conflicts, Process spacing options, Perform appropriate maneuver

Talk tracks (brief/execute/debrief)
- Pre-brief: "We'll focus on pattern discipline and traffic awareness at M54"
- In-pattern: "Announce your position and intentions, scan for traffic"
- Debrief: "How did you maintain safe separation? What would you do differently?"

Assessment plan
- Evaluate proper pattern altitude and airspeed maintenance
- Assess traffic scanning and collision avoidance
- Test knowledge of pattern procedures and emergency actions
- Observe teaching effectiveness in pattern operations

Quick-reference
- Standard pattern altitudes and procedures
- Traffic pattern communications for non-towered airports
- Wake turbulence separation requirements
- Emergency pattern procedures
