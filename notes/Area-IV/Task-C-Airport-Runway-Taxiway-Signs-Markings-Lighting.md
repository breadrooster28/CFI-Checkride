Title: Area IV Task C — Airport, Runway, and Taxiway Signs, Markings, and Lighting (CFI Applicant Notes, ASEL)

ACS Objective
- Determine that the applicant can teach airport signs, markings, and lighting systems, apply it, manage risks, demonstrate skills, and provide effective instruction.

References (per ACS for this Task only)
- FAA-H-8083-2 (Risk Management Handbook)
- FAA-H-8083-25 (Pilot's Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge)
- AIM (Aeronautical Information Manual)
- AC 150/5340-18H (Standards for Airport Sign Systems)

Scope (ACS mapping)
- Knowledge: FI.IV.C.K1–K5 (airport signs, runway markings, taxiway markings, lighting systems, hot spots)
- Risk Management: FI.IV.C.R1–R3 (runway incursions, taxiway confusion, lighting interpretation)
- Skills: FI.IV.C.S1–S2 (demonstrate sign/marking interpretation, teach airport surface navigation)

What I will teach (Knowledge)
- Runway markings: centerline, threshold, aiming point, touchdown zone, side stripes (AIM 2-3-3)
- Taxiway markings: centerline, edge, hold position, ILS critical area (AIM 2-3-4)
- Airport signs: mandatory (red/white), location (black/yellow), direction (yellow/black), destination (yellow/black) (AIM 2-3-8)
- Airport lighting: runway edge, threshold, approach, taxiway, obstruction (AIM 2-1-1 through 2-1-10)
- Hot spot identification and navigation procedures (AIM 2-3-5)
- Ground control procedures and phraseology for complex airports

How I will manage and teach risk (Risk Management)
- Identify: runway incursions, wrong taxiway, confusion at complex airports, poor visibility conditions
- Assess: verify position using multiple references, confirm clearances, maintain situational awareness
- Mitigate: use progressive taxi when uncertain, stop and ask for clarification, review airport diagram before taxi
- Teach systematic approach to airport surface navigation and incursion prevention (RMH Chapter 5)

How I will demonstrate skills and evaluate learning (Skills)
- Demonstrate proper interpretation of signs, markings, and lighting
- Teach systematic approach to airport diagram study and navigation
- Practice taxi procedures at various airport complexities
- Model proper communication with ground control
- Evaluate student's ability to navigate safely and teach others

Phase-of-instruction techniques
- Ground: Study airport diagrams, review signs and markings, discuss hot spots
- Preflight: Brief taxi route, identify potential problem areas
- Taxi: Point out signs and markings, verify position, practice hold short procedures
- Postflight: Debrief taxi procedures and discuss any confusion or errors

Scenario-Based Training (SBT)
- Scenario: First flight to a towered airport with complex taxiway system and hot spots
- Variables: low visibility, busy ground traffic, amended taxi clearance
- Decision points: when to request progressive taxi, how to verify position, hold short compliance
- Focus on preventing runway incursions and maintaining situational awareness

Talk tracks (brief/execute/debrief)
- Pre-brief: "We'll study the airport diagram and identify potential problem areas"
- During taxi: "What does this sign tell us? Where are we on the diagram?"
- Debrief: "How can we improve our situational awareness and prevent incursions?"

Assessment plan
- Test knowledge of sign and marking meanings
- Evaluate ability to navigate using airport diagrams
- Assess situational awareness during taxi operations
- Observe teaching effectiveness for surface operations safety

Quick-reference
- Airport sign and marking color codes and meanings
- Standard taxi phraseology and procedures
- Hot spot awareness and navigation techniques
- Runway incursion prevention strategies
