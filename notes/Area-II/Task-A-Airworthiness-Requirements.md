Title: Area II — Task A: Airworthiness Requirements (ASEL)

ACS Objective
- Determine that I can teach and apply airworthiness requirements, manage associated risks, demonstrate skills, and provide effective instruction.

References
- FAA-H-8083-25 (Pilot's Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge)
- 14 CFR parts 61 and 91 (e.g., 61.3; 91.3, 91.7, 91.9, 91.203, 91.205, 91.207, 91.213)
- AFM/POH (aircraft specific)
- AIM (as applicable)
- Chart Supplement U.S. (as applicable)

Scope (ACS mapping)
- Knowledge: Required documents, airworthiness and registration, AFM/POH, required and inoperative equipment, inspections/ADs, ELT/transponder/tests.
- Risk Management: Legal/airworthiness status verification, inoperative equipment decisions, dispatch risk.
- Skills: Determine airworthiness and equipment requirements for a specific flight; apply inoperative equipment procedures; teach a repeatable preflight legality process.

What I will teach (Knowledge)
- Required documents for pilot and aircraft; ARROW documents.
- Airworthiness vs. maintenance status; required inspections (annual, 100-hour if applicable, AV1ATE).
- Airworthiness directives: purpose and compliance documentation (overview per PHAK/14 CFR).
- Required equipment (VFR day/night per 91.205; KOEL/AFM/POH; TCDS references).
- Inoperative equipment (91.213): no MEL pathway—determine if required by 91.205, KOEL, ADs, or AFM/POH; remove/deactivate/placard and log if permitted.
- Operating limitations (AFM/POH; markings and placards).
- ELT/transponder/altimeter/static system requirements and tests (91.207/91.413/91.411 concepts).

How I will manage and teach risk (Risk Management)
- Identify: expired inspections, missing documentation, unmet ADs, inop equipment that is actually required, pressure to go.
- Assess: legality and safety impact; likelihood/severity of dispatch with unknown status.
- Mitigate: use a standardized "airworthiness status" checklist; verify records; placard/log inop equipment properly; delay/cancel if not compliant; seek maintenance.

How I will demonstrate skills and evaluate learning (Skills)
- Walk through a real aircraft's logs to establish AV1ATE status and AD compliance summary (if available).
- Use 91.213 decision flow for an inop landing light during day/night.
- Verify required documents and required equipment for a day/night VFR local flight.

Phase-of-instruction techniques
- Preflight: documents/records review; required equipment check; inop equipment evaluation.
- Taxi/flight: monitor equipment performance; re-evaluate if failures occur.
- Postflight: document discrepancies and ensure proper write-ups.

SBT
- Scenario: Night VFR local flight; landing light inoperative discovered during preflight. Apply 91.213, required equipment, and make a go/no-go with mitigations.

Talk tracks
- "Show me your AV1ATE/ARROW flow and how you prove each item."
- "What makes this inoperative item 'required' or 'not required' for tonight's flight?"

Assessment plan
- Learner can establish airworthiness/inspection status, apply 91.213 correctly, and articulate a compliant mitigation or a no-go decision.

Quick-reference
- ARROW; AV1ATE; 91.205 required equipment; 91.213 inoperative equipment flow.

Traceability
- PHAK: Airworthiness requirements, maintenance and inspection.
- 14 CFR 61/91: certificates, responsibilities, airworthiness, equipment, inspections.
- AFM/POH: operating limitations, KOEL.
