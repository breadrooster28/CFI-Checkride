Title: Area II — Task B: Weather Information (ASEL)

ACS Objective
- Determine that I can teach and apply weather theory, products, and decision-making, manage risks, demonstrate skills, and provide effective instruction.

References
- FAA-H-8083-25 (Pilot's Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge)
- AIM (Weather chapters and services)
- 14 CFR part 91 (e.g., 91.103 preflight action)
- Chart Supplement U.S. (as applicable)

Scope (ACS mapping)
- Knowledge: Basic weather theory; surface/upper-air patterns; fronts; stability; clouds/icing/turbulence; winds/visibility; local effects; weather briefing sources/products; updates enroute.
- Risk Management: Weather minima and personal minimums; convective activity; icing/turbulence hazards; ceilings/visibility trends; alternate plans.
- Skills: Obtain/interpret a full briefing; synthesize products; make go/no-go/continue decisions with rationale.

What I will teach (Knowledge)
- Fundamentals: pressure systems, fronts, stability, lapse rates, fog types, icing types, turbulence causes (PHAK).
- Products and use cases: METAR/TAF, Radar, Satellite, Prog charts, surface analysis, winds aloft, PIREPs, AIRMET/SIGMET/Convective SIGMET, NOTAM-D for weather-related closures (PHAK/AIM).
- Briefing workflow: 91.103 preflight action; sources (FSS/Leidos, online, ATIS/AWOS/ASOS); updates (HIWAS no longer provided—use current AIM sources).
- Interpretation pitfalls: TAF limitations; convective timing uncertainty; microclimates.

How I will manage and teach risk (Risk Management)
- Identify: embedded thunderstorm risk, low ceilings/vis trends, icing layers, mountain wave/LLWS.
- Assess: ceilings/vis vs route/terrain; timing confidence; escape options; personal minimums vs regulatory.
- Mitigate: alternate plans, fuel reserves, go/no-go criteria, enroute updates, diversion options; personal minimums above regulatory.

How I will demonstrate skills and evaluate learning (Skills)
- Obtain and interpret a full weather briefing for a cross-country flight using multiple sources.
- Demonstrate synthesis of weather products to identify hazards and trends.
- Apply go/no-go decision-making with clear rationale based on conditions vs. minimums.
- Show enroute weather update procedures and continuation/diversion decisions.

Phase-of-instruction techniques
- Preflight: comprehensive briefing using standard sources; identify key hazards and alternates.
- Departure: verify conditions match forecast; establish update schedule.
- Enroute: periodic weather checks; re-evaluate continuation vs. diversion.
- Approach: current conditions vs. approach minimums; missed approach planning.

SBT
- Scenario: VFR cross-country with deteriorating conditions enroute; scattered to broken clouds lowering; visibility decreasing. Practice obtaining updates, applying personal minimums, and making diversion decisions.

Talk tracks
- "Walk me through your weather briefing flow and key decision points."
- "What weather hazard concerns you most for this route and why?"
- "At what point do you divert, and where do you go?"

Assessment plan
- Learner can obtain comprehensive briefing, identify primary hazards, articulate personal minimums, and make sound go/no-go/continue decisions with supporting rationale.

Quick-reference
- 91.103 preflight action; METAR/TAF interpretation; briefing sources; personal minimums; diversion criteria.

Traceability
- PHAK: Weather theory, systems, hazards, products.
- AIM: Weather services, briefing procedures, updates.
