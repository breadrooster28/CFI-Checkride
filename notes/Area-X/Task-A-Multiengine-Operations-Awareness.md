Title: Area X Task A â€” Multiengine Operations Awareness (CFI Applicant Notes, ASEL)

ACS Objective
- Note: This area is primarily for multiengine aircraft. For ASEL CFI applicants, understanding multiengine operations concepts may be beneficial for comprehensive flight instruction knowledge.

References (per ACS for this Task only)
- FAA-H-8083-2 (Risk Management Handbook)
- FAA-H-8083-3 (Airplane Flying Handbook)
- FAA-H-8083-25 (Pilot's Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge)

Scope (ACS mapping)
- Knowledge: Understanding of multiengine concepts for comprehensive instruction
- Risk Management: Awareness of multiengine-specific risks and considerations
- Skills: Ability to discuss multiengine operations with students

What I will teach (Knowledge)
- Multiengine aircraft concepts: engine-out procedures, Vmc, performance considerations
- Critical engine effects: P-factor, spiraling slipstream, torque effects
- Single-engine operations: best glide speeds, emergency procedures
- Performance factors: single-engine ceiling, takeoff/landing distances
- Systems differences: fuel, electrical, hydraulic system redundancy
- Note: ASEL CFI may not demonstrate multiengine procedures but should understand concepts

How I will manage and teach risk (Risk Management)
- Identify: engine failure scenarios, performance limitations, system failures
- Assess: weather minimums, airport requirements for multiengine operations
- Mitigate: proper training requirements, understanding of limitations
- Address the importance of proper multiengine training and currency

How I will demonstrate skills and evaluate learning (Skills)
- Discuss multiengine concepts and their applications
- Explain differences between single and multiengine operations
- Address when multiengine training becomes necessary
- Teach importance of proper multiengine instruction and currency
- Provide foundational knowledge for future multiengine training

Phase-of-instruction techniques
- Ground: Discuss multiengine theory and operational differences
- Application: Relate concepts to single-engine operations
- Planning: Address training progression and multiengine considerations

Scenario-Based Training (SBT)
- Scenario: Student inquiring about multiengine training progression
- Variables: mission requirements, training costs, operational considerations
- Focus on proper training sequence and safety considerations

Talk tracks (brief/execute/debrief)
- Pre-brief: "We'll discuss multiengine concepts and training considerations"
- Discussion: "Understanding these concepts helps with overall aviation knowledge"
- Debrief: "When would multiengine training be appropriate for your mission?"

Assessment plan
- Evaluate understanding of multiengine concepts
- Assess ability to explain differences and training requirements
- Test knowledge of when multiengine operations become necessary

Quick-reference
- Key concepts: Vmc, critical engine, single-engine performance
- Training progression: proper sequencing from single to multiengine
- Safety emphasis: importance of proper multiengine training
- Note: ASEL CFI focuses on concepts, not practical demonstration
