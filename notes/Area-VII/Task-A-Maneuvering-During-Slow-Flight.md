Title: Area VII Task A — Maneuvering During Slow Flight (CFI Applicant Notes, ASEL)

ACS Objective
- Determine that the applicant can teach maneuvering during slow flight procedures, apply it, manage risks, demonstrate skills, and provide effective instruction.

- FAA-H-8083-2 (Risk Management Handbook)
- FAA-H-8083-3 (Airplane Flying Handbook)
- FAA-H-8083-25 (Pilot's Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge)

Scope (ACS mapping)
- Knowledge: FI.VII.A.K1–K4 (slow flight characteristics, stall warning recognition, power/attitude relationships)
- Risk Management: FI.VII.A.R1–R3 (stall/spin awareness, altitude loss, configuration management)
- Skills: FI.VII.A.S1–S3 (demonstrate slow flight, teach proper control techniques, manage configuration)

What I will teach (Knowledge)
- Slow flight fundamentals: flight at minimum controllable airspeed with stall warning (AFH 4-2)
- C172M slow flight: typically 45-50 KIAS with full flaps, stall horn activation
- Power/attitude relationship: high power required to maintain altitude at slow speeds
- Control effectiveness: reduced control authority, increased control pressures
- Configuration effects: flaps increase drag and change pitch characteristics
- Stall warning recognition: aerodynamic and artificial stall warning systems

How I will manage and teach risk (Risk Management)
- Identify: inadvertent stall/spin, altitude loss, spatial disorientation, configuration errors
- Assess: student understanding of energy management, stall warning recognition
- Mitigate: maintain safe altitude for recovery, practice proper control techniques
- Emphasize energy management and stall/spin awareness throughout training

How I will demonstrate skills and evaluate learning (Skills)
- Demonstrate smooth entry to slow flight configuration and speed
- Show coordinated flight control during slow flight maneuvering
- Maintain altitude and heading while maneuvering at minimum controllable airspeed
- Teach proper recovery technique and energy management
- Practice various configurations and power settings

Phase-of-instruction techniques
- Ground: Discuss slow flight theory, stall warning systems, energy management
- Entry: Demonstrate gradual power reduction and configuration changes
- Maneuvering: Show gentle control inputs for turns, climbs, and descents
- Recovery: Practice smooth transition back to normal flight

Scenario-Based Training (SBT)
- Scenario: Slow flight practice in airport traffic pattern environment
- Variables: wind conditions, traffic spacing requirements, configuration changes
- Focus on energy management and maintaining aircraft control

Talk tracks (brief/execute/debrief)
- Pre-brief: "We'll practice flying at minimum controllable airspeed"
- During slow flight: "Feel the control pressures and listen for stall warnings"
- Debrief: "How did the aircraft respond differently at slow flight speeds?"

Assessment plan
- Evaluate slow flight entry and configuration management
- Assess control technique and coordination during maneuvering
- Test understanding of stall warning recognition and energy management

Quick-reference
- C172M slow flight: 45-50 KIAS, full flaps, high power setting
- Control technique: gentle inputs, increased control pressures
- Stall warning: horn activation, aerodynamic buffet, control feel
- Recovery: power addition, attitude adjustment, configuration as appropriate
