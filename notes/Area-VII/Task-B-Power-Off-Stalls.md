Title: Area VII Task B — Power-Off Stalls (CFI Applicant Notes, ASEL)

ACS Objective
- Determine that the applicant can teach power-off stall procedures, apply it, manage risks, demonstrate skills, and provide effective instruction.

References (per ACS for this Task only)
- FAA-H-8083-2 (Risk Management Handbook)
- FAA-H-8083-3 (Airplane Flying Handbook)
- FAA-H-8083-25 (Pilot's Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge)

Scope (ACS mapping)
- Knowledge: FI.VII.B.K1–K4 (stall characteristics, angle of attack, recovery procedures, landing configuration stalls)
- Risk Management: FI.VII.B.R1–R3 (altitude loss, spin potential, secondary stalls)
- Skills: FI.VII.B.S1–S3 (demonstrate power-off stalls, teach recognition and recovery, manage configurations)

What I will teach (Knowledge)
- Power-off stall characteristics: simulates approach/landing configuration stall (AFH 4-4)
- C172M power-off stall: occurs around 40-45 KIAS in landing configuration
- Stall progression: decreased airflow, control effectiveness loss, aerodynamic warning signs
- Recovery technique: reduce angle of attack, add power, recover altitude smoothly
- Configuration effects: landing flaps create earlier stall with different characteristics
- Critical angle of attack: stall occurs at same AOA regardless of airspeed or attitude

How I will manage and teach risk (Risk Management)
- Identify: altitude loss during recovery, spin entry, secondary stalls, configuration errors
- Assess: adequate altitude for safe practice, student readiness for stall training
- Mitigate: practice at safe altitude (minimum 3000 AGL), proper recovery technique
- Emphasize coordinated controls to prevent spin entry

How I will demonstrate skills and evaluate learning (Skills)
- Demonstrate deliberate stall entry with proper configuration and technique
- Show recognition of stall warning signs and immediate recovery
- Maintain coordinated flight throughout stall and recovery sequence
- Teach students to recognize approach-to-landing stall scenario
- Practice various recovery techniques and configurations

Phase-of-instruction techniques
- Ground: Discuss stall theory, angle of attack concepts, recovery procedures
- Setup: Demonstrate proper configuration and clearing procedures
- Stall entry: Show deliberate stall with landing configuration
- Recovery: Practice immediate response and smooth altitude recovery

Scenario-Based Training (SBT)
- Scenario: Base-to-final turn with excessive back pressure leading to stall
- Variables: low altitude, distraction, configuration changes
- Focus on recognition, immediate recovery, and spin prevention

Talk tracks (brief/execute/debrief)
- Pre-brief: "We'll practice stall recognition and immediate recovery"
- During stall: "Feel the stall warning signs, recover immediately"
- Debrief: "What warning signs did you notice before the stall?"

Assessment plan
- Evaluate stall recognition and recovery timing
- Assess coordination and spin prevention techniques
- Test understanding of stall aerodynamics and configuration effects

Quick-reference
- C172M configuration: landing flaps, idle power, clean entry
- Stall speed: approximately 40-45 KIAS in landing configuration
- Recovery: reduce AOA, add power, level wings, recover altitude
- Prevention: maintain coordinated flight, recognize warning signs
