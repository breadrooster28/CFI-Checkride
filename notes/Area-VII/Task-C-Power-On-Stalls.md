Title: Area VII Task C — Power-On Stalls (CFI Applicant Notes, ASEL)

ACS Objective
- Determine that the applicant can teach power-on stall procedures, apply it, manage risks, demonstrate skills, and provide effective instruction.

References (per ACS for this Task only)
- FAA-H-8083-2 (Risk Management Handbook)
- FAA-H-8083-3 (Airplane Flying Handbook)
- FAA-H-8083-25 (Pilot's Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge)

Scope (ACS mapping)
- Knowledge: FI.VII.C.K1–K4 (departure stall characteristics, P-factor effects, recovery procedures)
- Risk Management: FI.VII.C.R1–R3 (altitude loss, left turning tendency, secondary stalls)
- Skills: FI.VII.C.S1–S3 (demonstrate power-on stalls, teach recognition and recovery, manage power effects)

What I will teach (Knowledge)
- Power-on stall characteristics: simulates departure/climb configuration stall (AFH 4-5)
- C172M power-on stall: occurs around 50-55 KIAS in takeoff configuration
- P-factor effects: left turning tendency during high power, high angle of attack
- Stall characteristics: more pronounced buffet, nose-high attitude, potential for spin
- Recovery technique: reduce angle of attack first, then adjust power and configuration
- Departure stall scenario: excessive back pressure during initial climb

How I will manage and teach risk (Risk Management)
- Identify: altitude loss, left turning tendency, spin potential, excessive nose-high attitude
- Assess: adequate altitude for recovery, student understanding of power effects
- Mitigate: use proper rudder control, practice at safe altitude, emphasize coordinated recovery
- Address P-factor and torque effects during high-power stall practice

How I will demonstrate skills and evaluate learning (Skills)
- Demonstrate deliberate power-on stall entry with takeoff configuration
- Show recognition of stall warning and immediate recovery technique
- Maintain coordinated flight despite P-factor and torque effects
- Teach students to recognize departure stall scenarios
- Practice recovery with emphasis on angle of attack reduction first

Phase-of-instruction techniques
- Ground: Discuss power effects, P-factor, departure stall scenarios
- Setup: Demonstrate proper configuration and power setting for entry
- Stall entry: Show effect of power on stall characteristics
- Recovery: Emphasize proper sequence and coordination

Scenario-Based Training (SBT)
- Scenario: Departure stall during obstacle clearance climb
- Variables: high density altitude, maximum gross weight, distraction
- Focus on recognition, proper recovery sequence, and energy management

Talk tracks (brief/execute/debrief)
- Pre-brief: "We'll practice departure-type stalls with power effects"
- During stall: "Control the left turning tendency, reduce angle of attack first"
- Debrief: "How did power affect the stall characteristics and recovery?"

Assessment plan
- Evaluate stall recognition and recovery technique
- Assess coordination and P-factor management
- Test understanding of power effects on stall characteristics

Quick-reference
- C172M configuration: takeoff flaps (10°), climb power, clean entry
- Stall speed: approximately 50-55 KIAS in takeoff configuration
- Recovery: reduce AOA first, manage power, control P-factor effects
- P-factor: right rudder required during high power, high AOA
