Title: Area VII Task D — Spin Awareness (CFI Applicant Notes, ASEL)

ACS Objective
- Determine that the applicant can teach spin awareness principles, apply it, manage risks, demonstrate skills, and provide effective instruction.

References (per ACS for this Task only)
- FAA-H-8083-2 (Risk Management Handbook)
- FAA-H-8083-3 (Airplane Flying Handbook)
- FAA-H-8083-25 (Pilot's Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge)
- AC 61-67C (Stall and Spin Awareness Training)

Scope (ACS mapping)
- Knowledge: FI.VII.D.K1–K4 (spin theory, entry conditions, recovery procedures, prevention techniques)
- Risk Management: FI.VII.D.R1–R3 (inadvertent spin entry, altitude loss, disorientation)
- Skills: FI.VII.D.S1–S3 (teach spin awareness, demonstrate prevention, manage spin scenarios)

What I will teach (Knowledge)
- Spin theory: uncoordinated stall with yaw leading to autorotation (AFH 4-12)
- Spin entry requirements: stall plus yaw (typically from uncoordinated controls)
- C172M spin characteristics: nose-down attitude, rapid rotation, significant altitude loss
- Recovery procedure: PARE - Power idle, Ailerons neutral, Rudder opposite spin, Elevator forward
- Prevention techniques: coordinated flight, stall awareness, proper control technique
- Phases of spin: entry, incipient, developed, recovery

How I will manage and teach risk (Risk Management)
- Identify: uncoordinated flight, stall with yaw input, cross-control situations
- Assess: aircraft spin certification, adequate altitude for recovery, pilot proficiency
- Mitigate: emphasize coordination, practice stall prevention, understand recovery procedures
- Note: C172M approved for spins in utility category only

How I will demonstrate skills and evaluate learning (Skills)
- Teach spin theory and recognition of spin-prone situations
- Demonstrate coordinated stall recovery to prevent spin entry
- Show effects of uncoordinated controls near stall
- Practice recovery procedures (academic in normal category aircraft)
- Emphasize spin prevention through proper stall training

Phase-of-instruction techniques
- Ground: Discuss spin aerodynamics, phases, recovery procedures
- Flight: Demonstrate coordination importance during stall practice
- Prevention: Show proper stall recovery techniques
- Awareness: Practice recognition of spin entry conditions

Scenario-Based Training (SBT)
- Scenario: Base-to-final turn with uncoordinated controls and stall
- Variables: distraction, improper rudder use, cross-control situations
- Focus on prevention through proper coordination and stall awareness

Talk tracks (brief/execute/debrief)
- Pre-brief: "We'll focus on spin prevention through coordination"
- During stalls: "Keep the ball centered, coordinate your controls"
- Debrief: "What situations could lead to inadvertent spin entry?"

Assessment plan
- Evaluate understanding of spin theory and entry conditions
- Assess coordination during stall practice
- Test knowledge of prevention techniques and recovery procedures

Quick-reference
- Spin entry: stall + yaw (uncoordinated flight)
- Recovery: PARE - Power, Ailerons, Rudder, Elevator
- Prevention: coordinated flight, proper stall technique, situational awareness
- C172M: spins approved in utility category only
