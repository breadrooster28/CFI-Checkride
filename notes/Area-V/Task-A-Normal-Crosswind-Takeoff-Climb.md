Title: Area V Task A — Normal and Crosswind Takeoff and Climb (CFI Applicant Notes, ASEL)

ACS Objective
- Determine that the applicant can teach normal and crosswind takeoff and climb procedures, apply it, manage risks, demonstrate skills, and provide effective instruction.

References (per ACS for this Task only)
- FAA-H-8083-2 (Risk Management Handbook)
- FAA-H-8083-3 (Airplane Flying Handbook)
- FAA-H-8083-25 (Pilot's Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge)
- POH/AFM (C172M)

Scope (ACS mapping)
- Knowledge: FI.V.A.K1–K4 (takeoff procedures, crosswind techniques, climb performance, common errors)
- Risk Management: FI.V.A.R1–R3 (wind conditions, runway length, obstacles, aircraft performance)
- Skills: FI.V.A.S1–S3 (demonstrate normal/crosswind takeoffs, teach proper techniques, evaluate performance)

What I will teach (Knowledge)
- Normal takeoff procedures: pre-takeoff checks, alignment, power application, rotation, initial climb (AFH 5-2)
- Crosswind takeoff techniques: aileron positioning, rudder use, wing-low method (AFH 5-4)
- Climb performance factors: weight, altitude, temperature, configuration (PHAK 11-5)
- C172M-specific procedures: Vr (55 KIAS), Vy (79 KIAS), Vx (62 KIAS), normal climb power (2400 RPM)
- Common errors: premature rotation, inadequate crosswind correction, poor directional control
- Performance calculations and runway analysis

How I will manage and teach risk (Risk Management)
- Identify: crosswind limits, short runways, obstacles, high density altitude, contaminated surfaces
- Assess: wind components vs. aircraft/pilot limits, runway length vs. performance requirements
- Mitigate: establish personal crosswind limits, calculate required distances, plan abort criteria
- Use PAVE assessment for takeoff decisions (RMH Chapter 2)

How I will demonstrate skills and evaluate learning (Skills)
- Demonstrate smooth, coordinated takeoff with proper control inputs
- Show crosswind correction techniques throughout takeoff roll and initial climb
- Maintain centerline control and proper climb attitude/airspeed
- Teach students to recognize and correct common errors
- Practice abort procedures and decision-making

Phase-of-instruction techniques
- Ground: Review takeoff theory, performance calculations, crosswind techniques
- Pre-takeoff: Brief wind conditions, obstacles, abort criteria, emergency procedures
- Takeoff: Demonstrate proper control inputs, explain corrections in real-time
- Climb: Establish proper attitude, power, and configuration for best performance

Scenario-Based Training (SBT)
- Scenario: Takeoff from M54 with 15-knot crosswind and rising density altitude
- Variables: gusty conditions, traffic pattern considerations, obstacle clearance
- Decision points: go/no-go based on conditions, abort criteria, climb performance
- 3P process: Perceive conditions, Process options, Perform appropriate technique

Talk tracks (brief/execute/debrief)
- Pre-brief: "We'll practice crosswind techniques and discuss abort criteria"
- During takeoff: "Apply aileron into the wind, use rudder to maintain centerline"
- Debrief: "How did you handle the crosswind? When would you abort the takeoff?"

Assessment plan
- Evaluate directional control and centerline tracking
- Assess proper crosswind correction throughout takeoff sequence
- Test knowledge of performance factors and limitations
- Observe teaching effectiveness and error correction techniques

Quick-reference
- C172M takeoff speeds: Vr 55 KIAS, Vy 79 KIAS, Vx 62 KIAS
- Crosswind technique: aileron into wind, rudder for centerline
- Normal takeoff: full power, rotate at Vr, climb at Vy
- Abort criteria: directional control, adequate acceleration, obstacles
