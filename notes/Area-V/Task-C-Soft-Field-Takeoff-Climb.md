Title: Area V Task C — Soft-Field Takeoff and Climb (CFI Applicant Notes, ASEL)

ACS Objective
- Determine that the applicant can teach soft-field takeoff and climb procedures, apply it, manage risks, demonstrate skills, and provide effective instruction.

References (per ACS for this Task only)
- FAA-H-8083-2 (Risk Management Handbook)
- FAA-H-8083-3 (Airplane Flying Handbook)
- POH/AFM (C172M)

Scope (ACS mapping)
- Knowledge: FI.V.C.K1–K3 (soft-field procedures, ground effect, performance considerations)
- Risk Management: FI.V.C.R1–R2 (surface conditions, obstacle clearance, performance limitations)
- Skills: FI.V.C.S1–S2 (demonstrate soft-field technique, teach proper procedures)

What I will teach (Knowledge)
- Soft-field takeoff technique: minimize ground contact, use ground effect, gradual acceleration (AFH 5-11)
- Control positioning: full back elevator initially, gradual forward as speed increases
- Ground effect benefits: reduced induced drag, improved performance below one wingspan height
- C172M considerations: avoid hard surfaces contact, protect nosewheel and propeller
- Performance factors: soft surface drag, obstacle clearance requirements, weight limitations

How I will manage and teach risk (Risk Management)
- Identify: soft surface conditions, obstacles, inadequate performance, aircraft damage risk
- Assess: surface firmness, runway length, obstacle clearance requirements
- Mitigate: proper technique execution, performance calculations, abort criteria
- Consider density altitude effects on soft-field performance

How I will demonstrate skills and evaluate learning (Skills)
- Demonstrate smooth control inputs to minimize ground contact
- Show proper use of ground effect for performance improvement
- Maintain proper attitude and speed throughout takeoff sequence
- Teach students to recognize appropriate conditions for soft-field technique

Phase-of-instruction techniques
- Ground: Explain ground effect theory and soft-field principles
- Taxi: Demonstrate proper control positioning and surface assessment
- Takeoff: Show gradual rotation and ground effect utilization
- Climb: Transition to normal climb when clear of obstacles

Scenario-Based Training (SBT)
- Scenario: Departure from grass strip with trees at departure end
- Variables: soft ground conditions, density altitude considerations
- Focus on proper technique execution and obstacle clearance

Talk tracks (brief/execute/debrief)
- Pre-brief: "We'll use ground effect to improve performance on soft surfaces"
- During takeoff: "Keep weight off the nosewheel, use ground effect"
- Debrief: "How did ground effect help our performance?"

Assessment plan
- Evaluate proper control technique and ground effect utilization
- Assess understanding of performance factors and limitations
- Test ability to teach soft-field procedures safely

Quick-reference
- Technique: full back elevator, gradual forward, use ground effect
- Performance: reduced by surface drag, enhanced by ground effect
- Safety: protect nosewheel, avoid prop strikes, plan obstacle clearance
