Title: Area V Task H — Go-Around/Rejected Landing (CFI Applicant Notes, ASEL)

ACS Objective
- Determine that the applicant can teach go-around/rejected landing procedures, apply it, manage risks, demonstrate skills, and provide effective instruction.

References (per ACS for this Task only)
- FAA-H-8083-2 (Risk Management Handbook)
- FAA-H-8083-3 (Airplane Flying Handbook)
- POH/AFM (C172M)

Scope (ACS mapping)
- Knowledge: FI.V.H.K1–K3 (go-around procedures, power application, configuration changes)
- Risk Management: FI.V.H.R1–R2 (decision criteria, altitude loss, traffic pattern re-entry)
- Skills: FI.V.H.S1–S2 (demonstrate go-around procedures, teach decision-making)

What I will teach (Knowledge)
- Go-around procedure: power, attitude, configuration, trim sequence (AFH 5-15)
- C172M go-around: full power, pitch attitude adjustment, flaps to 20°, carburetor heat off
- Decision criteria: unstabilized approach, runway conflicts, wind shear, poor visibility
- Configuration management: gradual flap retraction, gear considerations, trim adjustments
- Traffic pattern re-entry: communication, spacing, altitude management

How I will manage and teach risk (Risk Management)
- Identify: delayed decision, improper technique, altitude loss, traffic conflicts
- Assess: approach stability continuously, maintain go-around readiness
- Mitigate: establish clear go-around criteria, practice procedures regularly
- Emphasize go-around as normal procedure, not emergency

How I will demonstrate skills and evaluate learning (Skills)
- Demonstrate decisive go-around execution with proper technique
- Show proper power, attitude, and configuration management
- Execute safe traffic pattern re-entry and spacing
- Teach students to recognize go-around situations early

Phase-of-instruction techniques
- Ground: Discuss go-around criteria and procedures
- Pattern: Brief go-around triggers and traffic considerations
- Go-around execution: Demonstrate proper sequence and technique
- Re-entry: Show safe pattern integration and communication

Scenario-Based Training (SBT)
- Scenario: Unstabilized approach requiring go-around decision
- Variables: traffic on runway, wind shear, equipment malfunction
- Focus on decision-making timing and execution quality

Talk tracks (brief/execute/debrief)
- Pre-brief: "Go-around is always an option; we'll practice the procedure"
- During go-around: "Power, attitude, configuration—positive climb established"
- Debrief: "What triggered your go-around decision? How was the execution?"

Assessment plan
- Evaluate go-around decision-making and timing
- Assess technique execution and aircraft control
- Test understanding of criteria and risk factors

Quick-reference
- C172M procedure: full power, pitch up, flaps to 20°, positive climb
- Criteria: unstabilized approach, conflicts, weather, equipment issues
- Re-entry: communicate intentions, maintain spacing, coordinate with traffic
