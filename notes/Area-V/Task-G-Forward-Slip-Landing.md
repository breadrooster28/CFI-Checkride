Title: Area V Task G — Forward Slip to a Landing (CFI Applicant Notes, ASEL)

ACS Objective
- Determine that the applicant can teach forward slip to a landing procedures, apply it, manage risks, demonstrate skills, and provide effective instruction.

References (per ACS for this Task only)
- FAA-H-8083-2 (Risk Management Handbook)
- FAA-H-8083-3 (Airplane Flying Handbook)
- POH/AFM (C172M)

Scope (ACS mapping)
- Knowledge: FI.V.G.K1–K2 (slip procedures, energy management, recovery technique)
- Risk Management: FI.V.G.R1–R2 (excessive slip angles, altitude/airspeed control, limitations)
- Skills: FI.V.G.S1–S2 (demonstrate forward slip, teach energy management)

What I will teach (Knowledge)
- Forward slip technique: coordinated control inputs, energy dissipation, approach path steepening (AFH 4-7)
- C172M slip considerations: fuel system limitations with extended slips, elevator effectiveness
- Energy management: trading altitude for drag, maintaining airspeed control
- Recovery technique: gradual return to coordinated flight, normal approach resumption
- Appropriate use: high approach, obstacle clearance, emergency descent

How I will manage and teach risk (Risk Management)
- Identify: excessive slip angles, airspeed variations, altitude loss, spin potential
- Assess: approach stability, energy state, recovery altitude requirements
- Mitigate: maintain adequate airspeed, limit slip duration, practice recovery procedures
- Consider aircraft limitations and fuel system effects

How I will demonstrate skills and evaluate learning (Skills)
- Demonstrate controlled slip entry and maintenance
- Show proper energy management and airspeed control
- Execute smooth recovery to normal approach
- Teach appropriate use and limitations of forward slips

Phase-of-instruction techniques
- Ground: Explain slip aerodynamics and energy management principles
- Approach: Demonstrate slip entry and control techniques
- Slip execution: Show energy dissipation and path control
- Recovery: Practice smooth transition to normal approach

Scenario-Based Training (SBT)
- Scenario: High approach requiring energy dissipation for normal landing
- Variables: obstacle clearance, wind effects, approach stability
- Focus on energy management and safe recovery

Talk tracks (brief/execute/debrief)
- Pre-brief: "We'll use forward slip to manage approach energy"
- During slip: "Maintain airspeed, control descent rate with slip angle"
- Debrief: "How effectively did the slip manage your approach energy?"

Assessment plan
- Evaluate slip technique and energy management
- Assess airspeed control and recovery procedures
- Test understanding of slip applications and limitations

Quick-reference
- Technique: opposite rudder and aileron, maintain airspeed
- Energy management: increase drag, steepen approach path
- Recovery: gradual return to coordinated flight
