Title: Area V Task E — Short-Field Takeoff and Maximum Performance Climb (CFI Applicant Notes, ASEL)

ACS Objective
- Determine that the applicant can teach short-field takeoff and maximum performance climb procedures, apply it, manage risks, demonstrate skills, and provide effective instruction.

References (per ACS for this Task only)
- FAA-H-8083-2 (Risk Management Handbook)
- FAA-H-8083-3 (Airplane Flying Handbook)
- POH/AFM (C172M)

Scope (ACS mapping)
- Knowledge: FI.V.E.K1–K3 (short-field procedures, maximum performance climb, obstacle clearance)
- Risk Management: FI.V.E.R1–R2 (runway length, obstacles, performance margins)
- Skills: FI.V.E.S1–S2 (demonstrate short-field technique, teach performance optimization)

What I will teach (Knowledge)
- Short-field takeoff procedure: maximum power, proper rotation speed, obstacle clearance climb (AFH 5-9)
- C172M short-field technique: Vr at 55 KIAS, climb at Vx (62 KIAS) until obstacles cleared
- Performance calculations: takeoff distance, obstacle clearance requirements, weight effects
- Factors affecting performance: density altitude, wind, runway condition, aircraft weight
- Flap usage: typically 10° for short-field takeoff in C172M

How I will manage and teach risk (Risk Management)
- Identify: inadequate runway length, high obstacles, poor performance conditions
- Assess: calculate required vs. available distance, obstacle clearance margins
- Mitigate: reduce weight if necessary, wait for better conditions, consider alternate airports
- Establish abort criteria and practice abort procedures

How I will demonstrate skills and evaluate learning (Skills)
- Demonstrate precise airspeed control and maximum performance technique
- Show proper rotation at recommended speed and climb at Vx
- Maintain obstacle clearance throughout climb phase
- Teach performance calculation and decision-making skills

Phase-of-instruction techniques
- Ground: Calculate performance using POH charts, discuss technique
- Pre-takeoff: Brief obstacle locations, abort criteria, climb profile
- Takeoff: Demonstrate maximum power application and precise rotation
- Climb: Maintain Vx until obstacle clearance, then transition to Vy

Scenario-Based Training (SBT)
- Scenario: Departure from short runway with trees requiring obstacle clearance
- Variables: high density altitude, maximum gross weight, wind conditions
- Focus on performance margins and technique precision

Talk tracks (brief/execute/debrief)
- Pre-brief: "We'll maximize performance for obstacle clearance"
- During takeoff: "Rotate at 55, climb at 62 until clear of obstacles"
- Debrief: "How did our actual performance compare to calculated?"

Assessment plan
- Evaluate precise airspeed control and technique execution
- Assess understanding of performance factors and calculations
- Test ability to teach short-field procedures and decision-making

Quick-reference
- C172M speeds: Vr 55 KIAS, Vx 62 KIAS for obstacle clearance
- Configuration: 10° flaps, full power, precise rotation
- Performance: use POH charts for distance and climb calculations
