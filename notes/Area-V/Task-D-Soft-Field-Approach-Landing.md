Title: Area V Task D — Soft-Field Approach and Landing (CFI Applicant Notes, ASEL)

ACS Objective
- Determine that the applicant can teach soft-field approach and landing procedures, apply it, manage risks, demonstrate skills, and provide effective instruction.

References (per ACS for this Task only)
- FAA-H-8083-2 (Risk Management Handbook)
- FAA-H-8083-3 (Airplane Flying Handbook)
- POH/AFM (C172M)

Scope (ACS mapping)
- Knowledge: FI.V.D.K1–K3 (soft-field landing procedures, touchdown technique, rollout considerations)
- Risk Management: FI.V.D.R1–R2 (surface conditions, aircraft control, go-around criteria)
- Skills: FI.V.D.S1–S2 (demonstrate soft-field landing, teach proper technique)

What I will teach (Knowledge)
- Soft-field landing technique: power-on approach, gentle touchdown, weight control (AFH 5-13)
- Approach considerations: slightly slower approach speed, power management for control
- Touchdown technique: main gear first, minimum sink rate, maintain elevator back pressure
- Rollout procedures: keep weight off nosewheel, use brakes judiciously
- Surface assessment: recognizing soft field conditions and their effects

How I will manage and teach risk (Risk Management)
- Identify: soft surface hazards, nosewheel damage risk, loss of control, go-around necessity
- Assess: surface conditions, wind effects, aircraft performance capabilities
- Mitigate: proper technique execution, gentle touchdown, ready for go-around
- Plan for potential surface deterioration or unexpected conditions

How I will demonstrate skills and evaluate learning (Skills)
- Demonstrate controlled approach with power management
- Show gentle touchdown technique with proper control positioning
- Maintain aircraft control throughout rollout on soft surface
- Teach students to assess surface conditions and adjust technique accordingly

Phase-of-instruction techniques
- Ground: Discuss soft-field theory and technique requirements
- Approach: Demonstrate power-on approach and speed control
- Landing: Show gentle touchdown and weight transfer control
- Rollout: Demonstrate nosewheel protection and directional control

Scenario-Based Training (SBT)
- Scenario: Landing on grass strip with varying surface conditions
- Variables: wind effects, surface moisture, traffic considerations
- Focus on technique adaptation and go-around decision-making

Talk tracks (brief/execute/debrief)
- Pre-brief: "We'll focus on gentle touchdown and nosewheel protection"
- During approach: "Maintain power for control, gentle touchdown on mains"
- Debrief: "How did your technique protect the aircraft and maintain control?"

Assessment plan
- Evaluate approach technique and power management
- Assess touchdown gentleness and control positioning
- Test understanding of soft-field considerations and risks

Quick-reference
- Technique: power-on approach, main gear first, elevator back pressure
- Speed: slightly slower than normal, maintain control authority
- Rollout: protect nosewheel, gentle braking, maintain directional control
