Title: Area V Task B — Normal and Crosswind Approach and Landing (CFI Applicant Notes, ASEL)

ACS Objective
- Determine that the applicant can teach normal and crosswind approach and landing procedures, apply it, manage risks, demonstrate skills, and provide effective instruction.

References (per ACS for this Task only)
- FAA-H-8083-2 (Risk Management Handbook)
- FAA-H-8083-3 (Airplane Flying Handbook)
- FAA-H-8083-25 (Pilot's Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge)
- POH/AFM (C172M)

Scope (ACS mapping)
- Knowledge: FI.V.B.K1–K5 (approach procedures, crosswind techniques, landing performance, stabilized approach criteria)
- Risk Management: FI.V.B.R1–R3 (wind conditions, runway conditions, go-around criteria, approach stability)
- Skills: FI.V.B.S1–S3 (demonstrate normal/crosswind approaches, teach proper techniques, evaluate performance)

What I will teach (Knowledge)
- Stabilized approach criteria: proper airspeed, descent rate, configuration, alignment (AFH 5-6)
- Normal approach: pattern altitude to final, power management, flap deployment, airspeed control
- Crosswind approach techniques: crab method, wing-low method, combination method (AFH 5-8)
- C172M approach speeds: normal approach 65 KIAS, short final 60 KIAS with full flaps
- Landing performance factors: weight, density altitude, runway condition, wind (PHAK 11-8)
- Common errors: unstabilized approaches, improper crosswind correction, hard landings

How I will manage and teach risk (Risk Management)
- Identify: unstabilized approaches, excessive crosswind, contaminated runways, inadequate runway length
- Assess: approach stability using stabilized approach criteria, wind limits vs. aircraft capability
- Mitigate: establish go-around criteria, practice crosswind techniques, maintain approach discipline
- Use 3P decision-making for approach continuation vs. go-around (RMH Chapter 4)

How I will demonstrate skills and evaluate learning (Skills)
- Demonstrate smooth, stabilized approaches with proper power and attitude control
- Show effective crosswind correction techniques from pattern to touchdown
- Maintain proper approach speeds and descent rates
- Execute smooth roundout, flare, and touchdown with crosswind correction
- Teach recognition of unstabilized approaches and go-around decision-making

Phase-of-instruction techniques
- Pattern: Establish proper spacing, configure aircraft, brief approach
- Base leg: Begin descent, extend flaps, adjust power for proper approach angle
- Final approach: Maintain stabilized approach, apply crosswind correction, monitor for go-around criteria
- Landing: Execute proper roundout, flare, and rollout with directional control

Scenario-Based Training (SBT)
- Scenario: Approach to M54 with gusting crosswind and varying wind direction
- Variables: other traffic, wind shear reports, runway condition changes
- Decision points: continue vs. go-around, choice of crosswind technique
- Focus on maintaining stabilized approach criteria and safety margins

Talk tracks (brief/execute/debrief)
- Pre-brief: "We'll focus on stabilized approach criteria and crosswind techniques"
- On approach: "Check your approach: speed, sink rate, alignment, configuration"
- Debrief: "Was the approach stabilized? How effective was your crosswind correction?"

Assessment plan
- Evaluate maintenance of stabilized approach criteria
- Assess proper crosswind correction throughout approach and landing
- Test knowledge of go-around criteria and decision-making
- Observe teaching effectiveness for approach and landing techniques

Quick-reference
- C172M approach speeds: 65 KIAS normal, 60 KIAS short final
- Stabilized approach criteria: ±5 knots, ±100 fpm, on glidepath, proper config
- Crosswind techniques: crab to wing-low transition, maintain upwind aileron
- Go-around criteria: unstabilized approach, excessive sink rate, alignment issues
