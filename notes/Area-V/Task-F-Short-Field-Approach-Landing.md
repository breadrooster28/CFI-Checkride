Title: Area V Task F — Short-Field Approach and Landing (CFI Applicant Notes, ASEL)

ACS Objective
- Determine that the applicant can teach short-field approach and landing procedures, apply it, manage risks, demonstrate skills, and provide effective instruction.

- FAA-H-8083-2 (Risk Management Handbook)
- FAA-H-8083-3 (Airplane Flying Handbook)
- POH/AFM (C172M)

Scope (ACS mapping)
- Knowledge: FI.V.F.K1–K3 (short-field approach procedures, landing distance, obstacle clearance)
- Risk Management: FI.V.F.R1–R2 (approach stability, landing distance, go-around criteria)
- Skills: FI.V.F.S1–S2 (demonstrate short-field approach, teach precision techniques)

What I will teach (Knowledge)
- Short-field approach technique: steeper approach angle, precise speed control, obstacle clearance (AFH 5-12)
- C172M short-field approach: full flaps, approach at 61 KIAS, power management for precision
- Landing distance factors: approach speed, touchdown point, braking technique, surface condition
- Obstacle clearance on approach: planning descent angle, power management, go-around criteria
- Maximum braking technique and considerations

How I will manage and teach risk (Risk Management)
- Identify: inadequate approach angle, excessive speed, long landing, poor braking
- Assess: obstacle clearance margins, landing distance requirements, surface conditions
- Mitigate: practice precise speed control, plan touchdown point, maintain go-around option
- Calculate landing distance and compare to available runway

How I will demonstrate skills and evaluate learning (Skills)
- Demonstrate steep, stabilized approach with precise airspeed control
- Show accurate touchdown point control and maximum braking technique
- Maintain proper approach path for obstacle clearance
- Teach students to calculate and execute short-field approaches safely

Phase-of-instruction techniques
- Ground: Calculate landing distance, discuss approach planning
- Approach: Demonstrate steep approach angle and speed control
- Landing: Show precise touchdown point and maximum braking
- Rollout: Practice maximum braking without locking wheels

Scenario-Based Training (SBT)
- Scenario: Approach to short runway with obstacles on approach path
- Variables: wind conditions, runway condition, density altitude effects
- Focus on precision flying and performance optimization

Talk tracks (brief/execute/debrief)
- Pre-brief: "We'll use a steep approach for obstacle clearance and short landing"
- On approach: "Maintain 61 knots, plan touchdown at the numbers"
- Debrief: "How did our landing distance compare to the calculated distance?"

Assessment plan
- Evaluate approach precision and obstacle clearance
- Assess touchdown accuracy and braking technique
- Test understanding of landing performance factors

Quick-reference
- C172M approach: 61 KIAS, full flaps, steep approach angle
- Technique: precise speed control, planned touchdown point, maximum braking
- Performance: use POH landing distance charts, consider all factors
