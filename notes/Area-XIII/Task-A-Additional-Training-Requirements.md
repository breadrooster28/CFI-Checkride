- 14 CFR Part 91

Scope (ACS mapping)
- Knowledge: Additional requirements for ASEL operations and instruction
- Risk Management: Category-specific risk factors and considerations
- Skills: Application of category-specific training requirements

What I will teach (Knowledge)
- ASEL-specific training requirements: regulatory compliance, endorsement requirements
- Category and class limitations: understanding ASEL operating privileges
- Insurance and operational considerations: aircraft-specific requirements
- Advanced training opportunities: complex aircraft, high-performance endorsements
- Regulatory updates: staying current with changing requirements
- Professional development: continuing education for flight instructors

How I will manage and teach risk (Risk Management)
- Identify: training gaps, regulatory non-compliance, inadequate preparation
- Assess: student readiness for advanced training, regulatory requirements
- Mitigate: ensure proper training sequence, maintain regulatory compliance
- Address ongoing professional development and currency requirements

How I will demonstrate skills and evaluate learning (Skills)
- Demonstrate understanding of ASEL-specific requirements
- Show proper application of training regulations and endorsements
- Execute appropriate training sequences and progressions
- Teach students about ASEL privileges and limitations
- Plan appropriate advanced training pathways

Phase-of-instruction techniques
- Ground: Discuss ASEL requirements and training considerations
- Application: Relate requirements to practical flight training
- Planning: Develop appropriate training sequences and goals

Scenario-Based Training (SBT)
- Scenario: Student progressing through ASEL training requirements
- Variables: individual goals, regulatory changes, aircraft availability
- Focus on proper training sequence and regulatory compliance

Talk tracks (brief/execute/debrief)
- Pre-brief: "We'll review ASEL-specific training requirements and opportunities"
- Discussion: "Understanding these requirements ensures proper training progression"
- Debrief: "How do these requirements apply to your training goals?"

Assessment plan
- Evaluate understanding of ASEL-specific requirements
- Assess ability to plan appropriate training sequences
- Test knowledge of regulatory compliance and professional development

Quick-reference
