Title: Area IX Task A — Emergency Descent (CFI Applicant Notes, ASEL)

ACS Objective
- Determine that the applicant can teach emergency descent procedures, apply it, manage risks, demonstrate skills, and provide effective instruction.

References (per ACS for this Task only)
- FAA-H-8083-2 (Risk Management Handbook)
- FAA-H-8083-3 (Airplane Flying Handbook)
- POH/AFM (C172M)

Scope (ACS mapping)
- Knowledge: FI.IX.A.K1–K3 (emergency descent procedures, airspeed limitations, communication)
- Risk Management: FI.IX.A.R1–R2 (airspeed control, structural limits, terrain clearance)
- Skills: FI.IX.A.S1–S2 (demonstrate emergency descent, teach proper procedures)

What I will teach (Knowledge)
- Emergency descent scenarios: cabin pressurization loss, fire, structural icing, engine problems
- C172M emergency descent: reduce power to idle, extend flaps as appropriate, maintain Vno (127 KIAS)
- Descent technique: maximum safe descent rate while maintaining aircraft control
- Communication procedures: declare emergency, squawk 7700, advise ATC of intentions
- Configuration management: flaps to increase drag, gear extension if appropriate
- Recovery procedures: level-off technique and normal flight resumption

How I will manage and teach risk (Risk Management)
- Identify: excessive airspeed, structural damage, terrain/obstacle clearance, spatial disorientation
- Assess: nature of emergency, altitude available, suitable landing areas
- Mitigate: maintain airspeed within limits, plan descent profile, communicate with ATC
- Consider passenger oxygen requirements and time of useful consciousness

How I will demonstrate skills and evaluate learning (Skills)
- Demonstrate immediate response to emergency descent scenario
- Show proper configuration and airspeed management
- Maintain aircraft control throughout maximum descent
- Execute smooth recovery to normal flight
- Teach decision-making and emergency prioritization

Phase-of-instruction techniques
- Ground: Discuss emergency scenarios, descent techniques, decision-making
- Setup: Brief emergency scenario and expected response
- Execution: Demonstrate maximum descent with proper configuration
- Recovery: Show smooth transition back to normal flight

Scenario-Based Training (SBT)
- Scenario: Simulated cabin fire requiring immediate descent
- Variables: IMC conditions, terrain limitations, ATC coordination
- Focus on emergency prioritization and proper technique execution

Talk tracks (brief/execute/debrief)
- Pre-brief: "We'll practice emergency descent for various scenarios"
- During descent: "Power idle, configure for maximum descent, maintain Vno"
- Debrief: "How quickly did you establish the descent? What would improve your response?"

Assessment plan
- Evaluate response time and procedure execution
- Assess airspeed control and configuration management
- Test understanding of emergency priorities and decision-making

Quick-reference
- C172M procedure: power idle, flaps as appropriate, maintain Vno (127 KIAS)
- Communication: declare emergency, squawk 7700, advise intentions
- Configuration: maximize descent rate while maintaining control
- Recovery: smooth level-off, restore normal configuration
