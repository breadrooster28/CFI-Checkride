Title: Area IX Task B — Emergency Approach and Landing (Simulated) (CFI Applicant Notes, ASEL)

ACS Objective
- Determine that the applicant can teach emergency approach and landing procedures, apply it, manage risks, demonstrate skills, and provide effective instruction.

References (per ACS for this Task only)
- FAA-H-8083-2 (Risk Management Handbook)
- FAA-H-8083-3 (Airplane Flying Handbook)
- POH/AFM (C172M)

Scope (ACS mapping)
- Knowledge: FI.IX.B.K1–K3 (emergency approach procedures, field selection, approach planning)
- Risk Management: FI.IX.B.R1–R2 (altitude management, field suitability, approach stability)
- Skills: FI.IX.B.S1–S2 (demonstrate emergency procedures, teach decision-making)

What I will teach (Knowledge)
- Emergency approach scenarios: engine failure, partial power loss, forced landing situations
- Field selection criteria: size, surface, obstacles, wind direction, accessibility for rescue
- Approach planning: energy management, pattern setup, approach angle optimization
- C172M best glide: 65 KIAS for maximum glide distance, approximately 9:1 glide ratio
- Emergency procedures: troubleshooting, restart attempts, preparation for landing
- Communication: mayday calls, squawk 7700, passenger briefing for emergency

How I will manage and teach risk (Risk Management)
- Identify: altitude loss, poor field selection, delayed decision-making, panic responses
- Assess: available altitude, field options, wind conditions, aircraft configuration
- Mitigate: practice proper procedures, emphasize decision-making, prepare for various scenarios
- Plan for both simulated and actual emergency procedures training

How I will demonstrate skills and evaluate learning (Skills)
- Demonstrate immediate response to simulated engine failure
- Show proper field selection and approach planning techniques
- Maintain best glide speed and energy management
- Execute emergency procedures and decision-making process
- Teach calm, systematic approach to emergency situations

Phase-of-instruction techniques
- Ground: Discuss emergency scenarios, field selection, approach planning
- Setup: Brief simulated emergency procedures and safety considerations
- Execution: Demonstrate emergency approach with proper energy management
- Recovery: Practice go-around and normal operations resumption

Scenario-Based Training (SBT)
- Scenario: Simulated engine failure during cross-country flight near M54
- Variables: altitude available, field options, wind conditions, terrain
- Focus on decision-making speed and systematic emergency procedures

Talk tracks (brief/execute/debrief)
- Pre-brief: "We'll practice emergency approach procedures and decision-making"
- During emergency: "Best glide speed, select field, run emergency checklist"
- Debrief: "How was your decision-making? What would you do differently?"

Assessment plan
- Evaluate emergency response speed and decision-making
- Assess field selection criteria and approach planning
- Test understanding of energy management and emergency procedures

Quick-reference
- C172M best glide: 65 KIAS, approximately 9:1 glide ratio
- Field selection: size, surface, obstacles, wind, rescue access
- Emergency procedures: troubleshoot, communicate, prepare for landing
- Energy management: maintain best glide, plan approach profile
