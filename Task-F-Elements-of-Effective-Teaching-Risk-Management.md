Title: Area I — Task F: Elements of Effective Teaching that Include Risk Management and Accident Prevention (ASEL)

ACS Objective
- Demonstrate how I teach practical risk management, apply it, manage associated risks, demonstrate skills, and provide effective instruction.

References
- FAA-H-8083-2 (Risk Management Handbook)
- FAA-H-8083-9 (Aviation Instructor’s Handbook)
- FAA-H-8083-25 (Pilot’s Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge)

Scope (ACS mapping)
- Knowledge: FI.I.F.K1–K6 (risk ID/assessment/mitigation; PAVE; FRATs; when/how to introduce RM; techniques by phase; managing risk during instruction; ADM incl. CRM/SRM)
- Risk Management: FI.I.F.R1–R3 (instructional hazards; SA obstacles; human behavior/hazardous attitudes)
- Skills: FI.I.F.S1–S3 (SBT for RM/ADM; supervise/intervene/monitor learner and aircraft; model safety practices incl. collision avoidance, distraction mgmt, coordinated flight, positive exchange of controls, continuous awareness)

What I will teach (Knowledge)
- Hazard vs. risk; likelihood/severity; continuous re-evaluation (8083-2).
- PAVE and personal minimums; IMSAFE (8083-25).
- FRAT: preflight scoring, mitigations, thresholds, re-score (8083-2).
- ADM models: 3P/DECIDE; SRM/CRM elements; 5P at phase changes (8083-25, 8083-2).
- When/how to introduce RM: from Lesson 1, stated as objective and assessment; guided questioning to build independence (8083-9).
- Techniques by phase: preflight PAVE/FRAT/alternates; taxi incursion defenses; takeoff abort brief/EFATO plan; enroute clearing/scan/fuel/airspace checks; approach/landing stabilized criteria/go-around triggers; postflight debrief and personal mins update (8083-25, 8083-2, 8083-9).
- Managing risk while instructing: aviate–navigate–communicate–teach; early intervention; sterile cockpit; positive exchange of controls (8083-9).

How I will manage and teach risk (Risk Management)
- Identify: instructional distractions, role ambiguity, startle, pattern congestion, right-seat sightlines, hazardous attitudes (8083-9/25).
- Assess: qualitative matrix or FRAT (8083-2).
- Mitigate: set explicit triggers; adjust lesson scope; leverage ATC/automation; manage workload; use standard callouts (8083-2/25).

How I will demonstrate skills and evaluate learning (Skills)
- SBT: student leads PAVE/FRAT; apply 3P in real time; debrief updates to minimums (8083-9).
- Supervision: monitor energy/attitude/trends; “my controls” early when unstable; return controls when re-stabilized (8083-9).
- Model safety practices: clearing turns, scan techniques, traffic advisories, manage distractions, coordinated flight, 3-step positive exchange of controls (8083-25/9).

Phase-of-instruction techniques
- Preflight: top hazards/mitigations, alternates, go/no-go and knock-it-off language.
- Taxi: hotspots, readbacks, lighting/sterile cockpit.
- Takeoff: abort/go-around criteria, crosswind limits, EFATO options.
- Enroute: periodic 5P, fuel/time/position checks, automation mgmt.
- Approach/Landing: stabilized criteria; go-around default if unstable.

SBT
- Scenario: VFR pattern + maneuvers; rising crosswind; NOTAM hotspot; high DA; limited crosswind experience. Triggers: exceed personal min → delay/divert; unstable → go-around; congestion → replan.

Talk tracks
- “You lead PAVE/FRAT; I’ll probe assumptions. If unstable—go around. Controls: ‘You have,’ ‘I have,’ ‘You have.’”

Assessment plan
- Rubric includes: hazard ID, mitigations, adherence to triggers, communication clarity, aircraft control within stabilized criteria.

Quick-reference
- Tools: PAVE, IMSAFE, FRAT, 3P/DECIDE, 5P, SRM/CRM.
- Always brief: abort/go-around criteria; positive exchange of controls; sterile cockpit.
- Always do: clearing turns, scan, position reports (as applicable), periodic 3P.

Traceability
- 8083-2: risk process, PAVE/FRAT, ADM/SRM.
- 8083-9: integrating RM into instruction, SBT, positive exchange of controls.
- 8083-25: ADM models, hazardous attitudes, collision/incursion avoidance.
