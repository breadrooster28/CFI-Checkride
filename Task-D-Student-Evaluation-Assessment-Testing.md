Title: Area I — Task D: Student Evaluation, Assessment, and Testing (ASEL)

ACS Objective
- Determine that I understand evaluation and testing, can apply it, manage risks, demonstrate skills, and provide effective instruction.

Scope (ACS mapping)
- Knowledge: FI.I.D.K1–K7 (purpose/characteristics of effective assessment; traditional vs authentic; learner-centered assessment; maneuver/procedure grades; assessing risk management skills; choosing methods; critiques; oral assessment—question characteristics, questions to avoid, answering learner questions; assessment of piloting ability)
- Risk Management: FI.I.D.R1 (delivering an assessment)
- Skills: FI.I.D.S1 (use appropriate methods to assess in ground/flight)

What I will teach (Knowledge)
- Effective assessment (AIH): objective, flexible, acceptable, comprehensive, constructive, organized, thoughtful.
- Traditional tools: written/oral tests; pros/cons.
- Authentic tools: scenario-based, learner-centered grading, maneuver grades with risk elements.
- Oral assessment: clear, single-focus, adapted to level; avoid trivia, yes/no, and “do you understand?”
- Critiques: instructor/learner/self/peer; characteristics and methods.

How I will manage and teach risk (Risk Management)
- Identify: assessments that undermine safety focus; grading that ignores risk decisions.
- Assess: include specific RM/ADM behaviors in rubrics; evaluate “go-around/abort” decisions and workload mgmt.
- Mitigate: align assessment items to objectives and ACS; maintain supportive tone; separate safety issues from minor technique errors; ensure timely feedback to prevent negative transfer.

How I will demonstrate skills and evaluate learning (Skills)
- Use learner-centered grading with maneuver grades (e.g., explain, practice, perform), including risk decisions and communication.
- Oral questioning during flight: prioritize safety/ADM over minor deviations; use guided questions to elicit decision rationale.
- Provide a concise critique: start with strengths, address risk items, assign focused practice.

Phase-of-instruction techniques
- Pre-brief: publish grading criteria including RM/ADM expectations.
- In-flight: short prompts, allow safe errors within margins, intervene early for safety.
- Postflight: self-assessment first; instructor critique; update plan.

SBT
- Pattern operations with increasing complexity; assess stabilized criteria calls, go-around decisions, traffic scanning, and communications.

Talk tracks
- “Walk me through your decision: hazard, options, choice, outcome.”
- “What would you do differently to reduce risk next time?”

Assessment plan
- Rubric includes: aircraft control to tolerances, hazard ID, mitigation choice/timing, communication clarity.

Quick-reference
- Effective assessment characteristics; question types to avoid; include RM in every grade.

Traceability
- AIH: assessment types, learner-centered grading, oral assessment, critique methods.
- RMH/PHAK: include ADM/RM behaviors in evaluation.
