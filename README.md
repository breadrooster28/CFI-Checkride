# CFI ACS Notes (ASEL) — One File Per Task

Purpose
- Provide examiner-ready, instructor-focused notes for every ASEL Task in the CFI Airplane ACS.
- Each Task file aligns with ACS Objective, Knowledge, Risk Management, and Skills — using only the references listed for that Task.

How to use
1) Open notes/Area-*/Task-*.md for the Task you’ll teach or be evaluated on.
2) Use the built-in structure: What to teach, how to manage risk, how to demonstrate/assess skills, SBT scenario, talk tracks, quick references.
3) Debrief with the prompts included; update personal minimums and lesson plans based on outcomes.

Conventions
- References: strictly what the ACS lists for each Task (e.g., FAA-H-8083-2/9/25, AIM, ACs, CFRs).
- Method: scenario-based training (SBT), guided questioning, instructor “think-aloud,” authentic assessment.

Roadmap
- Area I is included. After you confirm, I’ll add Areas II–XIV in batches.
