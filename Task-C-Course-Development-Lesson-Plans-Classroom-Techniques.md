Title: Area I — Task C: Course Development, Lesson Plans, and Classroom Training Techniques (ASEL)

ACS Objective
- Determine that I understand the teaching process, can apply it, manage risks, demonstrate skills, and provide effective instruction.

Scope (ACS mapping)
- Knowledge: FI.I.C.K1–K10c (teaching process and essential skills; course of training; lesson prep—objectives/standards, performance- and decision-based objectives, ACS use; organize material; delivery methods—lecture, discussion, guided discussion, cooperative, demonstration-performance, drill/practice; e-learning; instructional aids/tech—characteristics, reasons, guidelines, types; integrated flight instruction; problem-based instruction; planning—blocks, syllabus, lesson plans)
- Risk Management: FI.I.C.R1 (selection of teaching method)
- Skills: FI.I.C.S1a–b (prepare an instructional lesson plan for aeronautical knowledge and for maneuver intro/ground lesson)

What I will teach (Knowledge)
- Teaching process (AIH): preparation, presentation, application, review/evaluation.
- Objectives: performance-based (conditions, behavior, standards) and decision-based; alignment with ACS.
- Organization: topical to-simple-to-complex; time and resource planning; blocks and syllabus.
- Methods: choose per objective and learner level; integrate demonstration-performance for maneuvers; guided discussion for ADM.
- Aids/tech: purposeful, accurate, simple, aligned with objectives; avoid overuse.
- Integrated flight instruction: always include instrument references and ADM.
- Problem- and scenario-based approaches: promote higher-order thinking and ADM (AIH).

How I will manage and teach risk (Risk Management)
- Identify: method–objective mismatch; tech distractions; content overload.
- Assess: learner engagement, retention, and transfer.
- Mitigate: pick method to match domain/stage; set sterile-cockpit rules for devices; trim scope to standards; embed ADM triggers (RMH/PHAK for decision frameworks).

How I will demonstrate skills and evaluate learning (Skills)
- Produce two lesson plans (knowledge and maneuver intro) with performance-based objectives, content outline, risk elements, references, and completion standards aligned to ACS.
- Select delivery method justified by objective and learner profile.
- Include integrated flight instruction and problem-based elements.

Phase-of-instruction techniques
- Pre-brief: state objectives/standards; identify risk elements and mitigations.
- Execution: demo–explain–student do; “talk-through” then “do/coach.”
- Debrief: self-assessment, instructor feedback, plan remediation.

SBT
- Design a crosswind-landing ground lesson: include PAVE elements, limitations, stabilized criteria, go-around triggers, and demonstration-performance steps.

Talk tracks
- “Our objective is measurable: by lesson end you will … under these conditions to these standards.”
- “What decision point ends the attempt and triggers the go-around?”

Assessment plan
- Check for alignment to ACS; clarity of objectives; suitability of method; inclusion of risk/ADM; appropriate aids.

Quick-reference
- Performance-based objective formula: Condition–Behavior–Standard.
- Choose method to domain/stage; keep aids simple and accurate.

Traceability
- AIH: teaching process, objectives, methods, aids, integrated instruction, PBI/SBT.
- RMH/PHAK: embed ADM/risk considerations in lesson design.
