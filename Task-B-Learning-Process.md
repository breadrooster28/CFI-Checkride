Title: Area I — Task B: Learning Process (ASEL)

ACS Objective
- Determine that I understand the learning process, can apply it, manage risks, demonstrate skills, and provide effective instruction.

Scope (ACS mapping)
- Knowledge: FI.I.B.K1–K16 (definitions, learning theories—behaviorism/cognitive; perceptions/insight; acquiring knowledge; laws; domains—cognitive/affective/psychomotor; characteristics; SBT; skill knowledge stages/results/development/plateaus; practice types; evaluation vs critique; distractions/interruptions/fixation/inattention; errors; memory—sensory/STM/LTM/use/forgetting; retention; transfer)
- Risk Management: FI.I.B.R1–R3 (inadequate instruction; lack of motivation; recognizing/correcting errors)
- Skills: FI.I.B.S1–S3 (apply educational theories; correct conditions undermining learning; plan/manage realistic distractions)

What I will teach (Knowledge)
- Learning models (AIH): behaviorism (reinforcement), cognitive (information processing), constructivism elements; perception/insight.
- Laws of learning: readiness, exercise, effect, primacy, intensity, recency.
- Domains and levels: cognitive/affective/psychomotor progressions; skill acquisition stages (cognitive–associative–automaticity); knowledge of results and deliberate practice; plateaus.
- Memory: sensory/STM/LTM; encoding strategies; causes of forgetting; retention techniques.
- Errors: sources, allowing safe errors, error management cycle; evaluation vs critique; SBT principles (AIH).
- Distractions/interruptions/fixation/inattention and their training use (AIH).

How I will manage and teach risk (Risk Management)
- Identify: weak objectives, poor scaffolding, fatigue, excessive task loading; demotivators.
- Assess: learner performance and affect; adjust challenge/complexity.
- Mitigate: performance-based objectives, bite-sized blocks, appropriate practice types; timely feedback; targeted remediation; structured distractions to build resilience.
- Promote error management and ADM reflection (RMH/PHAK link to decision-making quality).

How I will demonstrate skills and evaluate learning (Skills)
- Apply theory: match teaching method to domain and stage; use guided discovery for higher-order cognitive skills; drill-and-practice for psychomotor precision.
- Correct undermining conditions: remove distractions during initial learning; reintroduce realistic ones later; pace to avoid overload.
- Plan/manage distractions: pre-brief “sterile cockpit” and training distractions; debrief impact on performance.

Phase-of-instruction techniques
- Pre-lesson: set performance-based objectives and completion standards.
- In-lesson: chunk tasks; provide KR (knowledge of results) quickly; vary practice.
- Post-lesson: reflect on learning plateaus and next-step strategies.

SBT
- Scenario: navigation task with time pressure and optional radio interruptions; observe fixation; apply task management; debrief memory aids and workload strategies.

Talk tracks
- “Tell me your plan out loud; what cues trigger step 2?”
- “What single change would improve your result next time?”

Assessment plan
- Evidence: correct selection of method to domain/stage; ability to prevent/correct errors; performance stability under planned distractions.

Quick-reference
- Laws (primacy/effect/recency).
- Stages of skill; deliberate practice; KR.
- Distraction management plan.

Traceability
- AIH: learning theory, domains, practice, memory, SBT, assessment.
- RMH/PHAK: tie learning to decision-making quality and error management.
